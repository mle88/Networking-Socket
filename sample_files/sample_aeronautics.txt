[Line 1] but of four times the capacity of the first, for the reason shown by
[Line 2] my fourth supposition. Consequently the air contained in such a vessel
[Line 3] will be 718 lbs. 4⅔ ounces, so that if the air be drawn out of the
[Line 4] vessel it will be 410 lbs. 4⅔ ounces lighter than the same volume of
[Line 5] air, and, consequently, will be enabled to lift three men, or at least two, should they weigh more than eight pesi each. It is thus manifest
[Line 6] that the larger the ball or vessel is made, the thicker and more solid can the sheets of copper be made, because, although the weight will increase, the capacity of the vessel will increase to a greater extent
[Line 7] and with it the weight of the air therein, so that it will always be
[Line 8] capable to lift a heavier weight. From this it can be easily seen how
[Line 9] it is possible to construct a machine which, fashioned like unto a
[Line 10] ship, will float on the air.’ 
[Line 11] [Illustration: A suggestion for applying hydrogen gas to Lana’s ‘Aerial Ship.’ Rome, 1784.]  With four globes of these dimensions Lana proposed to make an aerial ship of the fashion shown in his quaint illustration. He is careful to
[Line 12] point out a method by which the supporting globes for the aerial ship may be entirely emptied of air; this is to be done by connecting to each globe a tube of copper which is ‘at least a length of 47 modern Roman palmi.’ A small tap is to close this tube at the end nearest the
[Line 13] globe, and then vessel and tube are to be filled with water, after which the tube is to be immersed in water and the tap opened, allowing the water to run out of the vessel, while no air enters. The tap is
[Line 14] then closed before the lower end of the tube is removed from the water,
[Line 15] leaving no air at all in the globe or sphere. Propulsion of this airship was to be accomplished by means of sails, and also by oars.  Lana antedated the modern propeller, and realised that the air would
[Line 16] offer enough resistance to oars or paddle to impart motion to any vessel floating in it and propelled by these means, although he did
[Line 17] not realise the amount of pressure on the air which would be necessary
[Line 18] to accomplish propulsion. As a matter of fact, he foresaw and provided
[Line 19] against practically all the difficulties that would be encountered in
[Line 20] the working, as well as the making, of the aerial ship, finally coming
[Line 21] up against what his religious training made an insuperable objection.
[Line 22] This, again, is best told in his own words:--
[Line 23] ‘Other difficulties I do not foresee that could prevail against this
[Line 24] invention, save one only, which to me seems the greatest of them all,
[Line 25] and that is that God would surely never allow such a machine to be
[Line 26] successful, since it would create many disturbances in the civil and
[Line 27] political governments of mankind.’  He ends by saying that no city would be proof against surprise, while the aerial ship could set fire to vessels at sea, and destroy houses,
[Line 28] fortresses, and cities by fire balls and bombs. In fact, at the end of
[Line 29] his treatise on the subject, he furnishes a pretty complete _résumé_ of
[Line 30] the activities of German Zeppelins.  As already noted, Lana himself, owing to his vows of poverty, was
[Line 31] unable to do more than put his suggestions on paper, which he did with
[Line 32] a thoroughness that has procured him a place among the really great pioneers of flying. 
[Line 33] It was nearly 200 years before any attempt was made to realise his project; then, in 1843, M. Marey Monge set out to make the globes and the ship as Lana detailed them. Monge’s experiments cost him the sum of 25,000 francs 75 centimes, which he expended purely from love of
[Line 34] scientific investigation. He chose to make his globes of brass, about
[Line 35] .004 in thickness, and weighing 1.465 lbs. to the square yard. Having made his sphere of this metal, he lined it with two thicknesses of
[Line 36] tissue paper, varnished it with oil, and set to work to empty it of
[Line 37] air. This, however, he never achieved, for such metal is incapable of
[Line 38] sustaining the pressure of the outside air, as Lana, had he had the
[Line 39] means to carry out experiments, would have ascertained. M. Monge’s sphere could never be emptied of air sufficiently to rise from the
[Line 40] earth; it ended in the melting-pot, ignominiously enough, and all that Monge got from his experiment was the value of the scrap metal and the satisfaction of knowing that Lana’s theory could never be translated into practice.
[Line 41] Robert Hooke is less conspicuous than either Borelli or Lana; his work, which came into the middle of the seventeenth century, consisted of various experiments with regard to flight, from which emerged ‘a Module, which by the help of Springs and Wings, raised and sustained itself in the air.’ This must be reckoned as the first model flying machine which actually flew, except for da Vinci’s helicopters; Hooke’s
[Line 42] model appears to have been of the flapping-wing type--he attempted to copy the motion of birds, but found from study and experiment that
[Line 43] human muscles were not sufficient to the task of lifting the human body. For that reason, he says, ‘I applied my mind to contrive a way
[Line 44] to make artificial muscles,’ but in this he was, as he expresses it, ‘frustrated of my expectations.’ Hooke’s claim to fame rests mainly on his successful model; the rest of his work is of too scrappy a nature
[Line 45] to rank as a serious contribution to the study of flight.  Contemporary with Hooke was one Allard, who, in France, undertook to emulate the Saracen of Constantinople to a certain extent. Allard was a tight-rope dancer who either did or was said to have done short gliding flights--the matter is open to question--and finally stated that he would, at St Germains, fly from the terrace in the king’s presence. He made the attempt, but merely fell, as did the Saracen some centuries
[Line 46] before, causing himself serious injury. Allard cannot be regarded as a contributor to the development of aeronautics in any way, and is only mentioned as typical of the way in which, up to the time of the Wright
[Line 47] brothers, flying was regarded. Even unto this day there are many who
[Line 48] still believe that, with a pair of wings, man ought to be able to fly, and that the mathematical data necessary to effective construction simply do not exist. This attitude was reasonable enough in an
[Line 49] unlearned age, and Allard was one--a little more conspicuous than the majority--among many who made experiment in ignorance, with more or less danger to themselves and without practical result of any kind.
[Line 50] [Illustration: Besnier’s Flying Apparatus.] 
[Line 51] The seventeenth century was not to end, however, without practical
[Line 52] experiment of a noteworthy kind in gliding flight. Among the recruits
[Line 53] to the ranks of pioneers was a certain Besnier, a locksmith of Sablé,
[Line 54] who somewhere between 1675 and 1680 constructed a glider of which a crude picture has come down to modern times. The apparatus, as will be seen, consisted of two rods with hinged flaps, and the original designer of the picture seems to have had but a small space in which to draw, since obviously the flaps must have been much larger than those shown. Besnier placed the rods on his shoulders, and worked the flaps by cords attached to his hands and feet--the flaps opened as they fell, and closed as they rose, so the device as a whole must be regarded as
[Line 55] a sort of flapping glider. Having by experiment proved his apparatus successful, Besnier promptly sold it to a travelling showman of the
[Line 56] period, and forthwith set about constructing a second set, with which
[Line 57] he made gliding flights of considerable height and distance. Like Lilienthal, Besnier projected himself into space from some height, and
[Line 58] then, according to the contemporary records, he was able to cross a
[Line 59] river of considerable size before coming to earth. It does not appear that he had any imitators, or that any advantage whatever was taken
[Line 60] of his experiments; the age was one in which he would be regarded rather as a freak exhibitor than as a serious student, and possibly,
[Line 61] considering his origin and the sale of his first apparatus to such a
[Line 62] client, he regarded the matter himself as more in the nature of an amusement than as a discovery. 
[Line 63] Borelli, coming at the end of the century, proved to his own satisfaction and that of his fellows that flapping wing flight was an impossibility; the capabilities of the plane were as yet undreamed, and the prime mover that should make the plane available for flight was
[Line 64] deep in the womb of time. Da Vinci’s work was forgotten--flight was an
[Line 65] impossibility, or at best such a useless show as Besnier was able to give.  The eighteenth century was almost barren of experiment. Emanuel
[Line 66] Swedenborg, having invented a new religion, set about inventing a
[Line 67] flying machine, and succeeded theoretically, publishing the result of his investigations as follows:--
[Line 68]  ‘Let a car or boat or some like object be made of light material such as cork or bark, with a room within it for the operator. Secondly, in front as well as behind, or all round, set a widely-stretched sail parallel to the machine, forming within a hollow or bend, which could
[Line 69] be reefed like the sails of a ship. Thirdly, place wings on the sides, to be worked up and down by a spiral spring, these wings also to be
[Line 70] hollow below in order to increase the force and velocity, take in the air, and make the resistance as great as may be required. These,
[Line 71] too, should be of light material and of sufficient size; they should
[Line 72] be in the shape of birds’ wings, or the sails of a windmill, or some
[Line 73] such shape, and should be tilted obliquely upwards, and made so as to collapse on the upward stroke and expand on the downward. Fourth, place a balance or beam below, hanging down perpendicularly for some distance
[Line 74] with a small weight attached to its end, pendent exactly in line with the centre of gravity; the longer this beam is, the lighter must it be, for it must have the same proportion as the well-known vectis or
[Line 75] steel-yard. This would serve to restore the balance of the machine if
[Line 76] it should lean over to any of the four sides. Fifthly, the wings would
[Line 77] perhaps have greater force, so as to increase the resistance and make
[Line 78] the flight easier, if a hood or shield were placed over them, as is
[Line 79] the case with certain insects. Sixthly, when the sails are expanded
[Line 80] so as to occupy a great surface and much air, with a balance keeping
[Line 81] them horizontal, only a small force would be needed to move the machine
[Line 82] back and forth in a circle, and up and down. And, after it has gained
[Line 83] momentum to move slowly upwards, a slight movement and an even bearing would keep it balanced in the air and would determine its direction at will.’
[Line 84]  The only point in this worthy of any note is the first device for maintaining stability automatically--Swedenborg certainly scored a
[Line 85] point there. For the rest, his theory was but theory, incapable of being put to practice--he does not appear to have made any attempt at advance beyond the mere suggestion.
[Line 86] Some ten years before his time the state of knowledge with regard to
[Line 87] flying in Europe was demonstrated by an order granted by the King of
[Line 88] Portugal to Friar Lourenzo de Guzman, who claimed to have invented a
[Line 89] flying machine capable of actual flight. The order stated that ‘In
[Line 90] order to encourage the suppliant to apply himself with zeal toward the improvement of the new machine, which is capable of producing the effects mentioned by him, I grant unto him the first vacant place in my College of Barcelos or Santarem, and the first professorship of
[Line 91] mathematics in my University of Coimbra, with the annual pension of 600,000 reis during his life.--Lisbon, 17th of March, 1709.’ 
[Line 92] What happened to Guzman when the non-existence of the machine was discovered is one of the things that is well outside the province of
[Line 93] aeronautics. He was charlatan pure and simple, as far as actual flight
[Line 94] was concerned, though he had some ideas respecting the design of
[Line 95] hot-air balloons, according to Tissandier. (_La Navigation Aerienne._) His flying machine was to contain, among other devices, bellows to produce artificial wind when the real article failed, and also magnets
[Line 96] in globes to draw the vessel in an upward direction and maintain its buoyancy. Some draughtsman, apparently gifted with as vivid imagination as Guzman himself, has given to the world an illustration of the
[Line 97] hypothetical vessel; it bears some resemblance to Lana’s aerial ship,
[Line 98] from which fact one draws obvious conclusions. 
[Line 99] A rather amusing claim to solving the problem of flight was made in the middle of the eighteenth century by one Grimaldi, a ‘famous
[Line 100] and unique Engineer’ who, as a matter of actual fact, spent twenty
[Line 101] years in missionary work in India, and employed the spare time that missionary work left him in bringing his invention to a workable state. The invention is described as a ‘box which with the aid of clockwork
[Line 102] rises in the air, and goes with such lightness and strong rapidity
[Line 103] that it succeeds in flying a journey of seven leagues in an hour. It
[Line 104] is made in the fashion of a bird; the wings from end to end are 25
[Line 105] feet in extent. The body is composed of cork, artistically joined together and well fastened with metal wire, covered with parchment and feathers. The wings are made of catgut and whalebone, and covered also with the same parchment and feathers, and each wing is folded
[Line 106] in three seams. In the body of the machine are contained thirty wheels of unique work, with two brass globes and little chains which alternately wind up a counterpoise; with the aid of six brass vases, full of a certain quantity of quicksilver, which run in some pulleys, the machine is kept by the artist in due equilibrium and balance. By means, then, of the friction between a steel wheel adequately tempered
[Line 107] and a very heavy and surprising piece of lodestone, the whole is kept
[Line 108] in a regulated forward movement, given, however, a right state of the winds, since the machine cannot fly so much in totally calm weather as
[Line 109] in stormy. This prodigious machine is directed and guided by a tail seven palmi long, which is attached to the knees and ankles of the inventor by leather straps; by stretching out his legs, either to the
[Line 110] right or to the left, he moves the machine in whichever direction he pleases.... The machine’s flight lasts only three hours, after which the wings gradually close themselves, when the inventor, perceiving this, goes down gently, so as to get on his own feet, and then winds
[Line 111] up the clockwork and gets himself ready again upon the wings for the continuation of a new flight. He himself told us that if by chance one of the wheels came off or if one of the wings broke, it is certain he would inevitably fall rapidly to the ground, and, therefore, he does not rise more than the height of a tree or two, as also he only once put himself in the risk of crossing the sea, and that was from Calais
[Line 112] to Dover, and the same morning he arrived in London.’ 
[Line 113] And yet there are still quite a number of people who persist in stating
[Line 114] that Bleriot was the first man to fly across the Channel! 
[Line 115] A study of the development of the helicopter principle was published in France in 1868, when the great French engineer Paucton produced his _Théorie de la Vis d’Archiméde_. For some inexplicable reason, Paucton was not satisfied with the term ‘helicopter,’ but preferred to call it a ‘ptérophore,’ a name which, so far as can be ascertained, has not been adopted by any other writer or investigator. Paucton stated that,
[Line 116] since a man is capable of sufficient force to overcome the weight of
[Line 117] his own body, it is only necessary to give him a machine which acts on
[Line 118] the air ‘with all the force of which it is capable and at its utmost
[Line 119] speed,’ and he will then be able to lift himself in the air, just as
[Line 120] by the exertion of all his strength he is able to lift himself in
[Line 121] water. ‘It would seem,’ says Paucton, ‘that in the ptérophore, attached vertically to a carriage, the whole built lightly and carefully assembled, he has found something that will give him this result in all perfection. In construction, one would be careful that the machine produced the least friction possible, and naturally it ought to produce
[Line 122] little, as it would not be at all complicated. The new Dædalus, sitting
[Line 123] comfortably in his carriage, would by means of a crank give to the ptérophore a suitable circular (or revolving) speed. This single
[Line 124] ptérophore would lift him vertically, but in order to move horizontally
[Line 125] he should be supplied with a tail in the shape of another ptérophore. When he wished to stop for a little time, valves fixed firmly across
[Line 126] the end of the space between the blades would automatically close the openings through which the air flows, and change the ptérophore into an
[Line 127] unbroken surface which would resist the flow of air and retard the fall
[Line 128] of the machine to a considerable degree.’
[Line 129]  The doctrine thus set forth might appear plausible, but it is based on the common misconception that all the force which might be put
[Line 130] into the helicopter or ‘ptérophore’ would be utilised for lifting or propelling the vehicle through the air, just as a propeller uses all its power to drive a ship through water. But, in applying such
[Line 131] a propelling force to the air, most of the force is utilised in
[Line 132] maintaining aerodynamic support--as a matter of fact, more force is
[Line 133] needed to maintain this support than the muscle of man could possibly
[Line 134] furnish to a lifting screw, and even if the helicopter were applied to a full-sized, engine-driven air vehicle, the rate of ascent would depend on the amount of surplus power that could be carried. For example, an upward lift of 1,000 pounds from a propeller 15 feet in diameter would demand an expenditure of 50 horse-power under the best possible conditions, and in order to lift this load vertically through such atmospheric pressure as exists at sea-level or thereabouts, an
[Line 135] additional 20 horse-power would be required to attain a rate of 11 feet per second--50 horse-power must be continually provided for the mere support of the load, and the additional 20 horse-power must be continually provided in order to lift it. Although, in model form,
[Line 136] there is nothing quite so strikingly successful as the helicopter in
[Line 137] the range of flying machines, yet the essential weight increases so
[Line 138] disproportionately to the effective area that it is necessary to go but very little beyond model dimensions for the helicopter to become quite ineffective.
[Line 139]  That is not to say that the lifting screw must be totally ruled out so far as the construction of aircraft is concerned. Much is still
[Line 140] empirical, so far as this branch of aeronautics is concerned, and
[Line 141] consideration of the structural features of a propeller goes to show that the relations of essential weight and effective area do not altogether apply in practice as they stand in theory. Paucton’s dream,
[Line 142] in some modified form, may yet become reality--it is only so short a time ago as 1896 that Lord Kelvin stated he had not the smallest molecule of faith in aerial navigation, and since the whole history of
[Line 143] flight consists in proving the impossible possible, the helicopter may yet challenge the propelled plane surface for aerial supremacy.
[Line 144] It does not appear that Paucton went beyond theory, nor is there in
[Line 145] his theory any advance toward practical flight--da Vinci could have
[Line 146] told him as much as he knew. He was followed by Meerwein, who invented an apparatus apparently something between a flapping wing machine
[Line 147] and a glider, consisting of two wings, which were to be operated by means of a rod; the venturesome one who would fly by means of this
[Line 148] apparatus had to lie in a horizontal position beneath the wings to work the rod. Meerwein deserves a place of mention, however, by reason of his investigations into the amount of surface necessary to support a given weight. Taking that weight at 200 pounds--which would allow for
[Line 149] the weight of a man and a very light apparatus--he estimated that 126 square feet would be necessary for support. His pamphlet, published
[Line 150] at Basle in 1784, shows him to have been a painstaking student of the potentialities of flight. 
[Line 151] Jean-Pierre Blanchard, later to acquire fame in connection with balloon flight, conceived and described a curious vehicle, of which
[Line 152] he even announced trials as impending. His trials were postponed time after time, and it appears that he became convinced in the end of
[Line 153] the futility of his device, being assisted to such a conclusion by Lalande, the astronomer, who repeated Borelli’s statement that it was
[Line 154] impossible for man ever to fly by his own strength. This was in the
[Line 155] closing days of the French monarchy, and the ascent of the Mongolfiers’
[Line 156] first hot-air balloon in 1783--which shall be told more fully in its
[Line 157] place--put an end to all French experiments with heavier-than-air apparatus, though in England the genius of Cayley was about to bud, and
[Line 158] even in France there were those who understood that ballooning was not true flight.
[Line 159]   III  SIR GEORGE CAYLEY--THOMAS WALKER   On the fifth of June, 1783, the Montgolfiers’ hot-air balloon rose at Versailles, and in its rising divided the study of the conquest of the air into two definite parts, the one being concerned with the
[Line 160] propulsion of gas lifted, lighter-than-air vehicles, and the other
[Line 161] being crystallised in one sentence by Sir George Cayley: ‘The whole problem,’ he stated, ‘is confined within these limits, viz.: to make
[Line 162] a surface support a given weight by the application of power to the resistance of the air.’ For about ten years the balloon held the field entirely, being regarded as the only solution of the problem of flight
[Line 163] that man could ever compass. So definite for a time was this view on the eastern side of the Channel that for some years practically all the
[Line 164] progress that was made in the development of power-driven planes was made in Britain.
[Line 165] In 1800 a certain Dr Thomas Young demonstrated that certain curved surfaces suspended by a thread moved into and not away from a
[Line 166] horizontal current of air, but the demonstration, which approaches perilously near to perpetual motion if the current be truly horizontal, has never been successfully repeated, so that there is more than a suspicion that Young’s air-current was _not_ horizontal. Others had made and were making experiments on the resistance offered to the air by flat surfaces, when Cayley came to study and record, earning such a place among the pioneers as to win the title of ‘father of British aeronautics.’
[Line 167] Cayley was a man in advance of his time, in many ways. Of independent means, he made the grand tour which was considered necessary to the
[Line 168] education of every young man of position, and during this excursion he was more engaged in studies of a semi-scientific character than in the pursuits that normally filled such a period. His various writings prove that throughout his life aeronautics was the foremost subject in his mind; the _Mechanic’s Magazine_, _Nicholson’s Journal_, the
[Line 169] _Philosophical Magazine_, and other periodicals of like nature bear
[Line 170] witness to Cayley’s continued research into the subject of flight. He approached the subject after the manner of the trained scientist,
[Line 171] analysing the mechanical properties of air under chemical and physical action. Then he set to work to ascertain the power necessary for aerial flight, and was one of the first to enunciate the fallacy of the hopes
[Line 172] of successful flight by means of the steam engine of those days, owing to the fact that it was impossible to obtain a given power with a given weight.  Yet his conclusions on this point were not altogether negative, for as early as 1810 he stated that he could construct a balloon which could travel with passengers at 20 miles an hour--he was one of the first to consider the possibilities of applying power to a balloon. Nearly
[Line 173] thirty years later--in 1837--he made the first attempt at establishing
[Line 174] an aeronautical society, but at that time the power-driven plane was regarded by the great majority as an absurd dream of more or less
[Line 175] mad inventors, while ballooning ranked on about the same level as
[Line 176] tight-rope walking, being considered an adjunct to fairs and fêtes,
[Line 177] more a pastime than a study.  Up to the time of his death, in 1857, Cayley maintained his study of
[Line 178] aeronautical matters, and there is no doubt whatever that his work
[Line 179] went far in assisting the solution of the problem of air conquest. His principal published work, a monograph entitled _Aerial Navigation_, has been republished in the admirable series of ‘Aeronautical Classics’
[Line 180] issued by the Royal Aeronautical Society. He began this work by pointing out the impossibility of flying by means of attached wrings,
[Line 181] an impossibility due to the fact that, while the pectoral muscles of a
[Line 182] bird account for more than two-thirds of its whole muscular strength, in a man the muscles available for flying, no matter what mechanism might be used, would not exceed one-tenth of his total strength.
[Line 183]  Cayley did not actually deny the possibility of a man flying by
[Line 184] muscular effort, however, but stated that ‘the flight of a strong
[Line 185] man by great muscular exertion, though a curious and interesting
[Line 186] circumstance, inasmuch as it will probably be the means of ascertaining
[Line 187] this power and supplying the basis whereon to improve it, would be of little use.’  From this he goes on to the possibility of using a Boulton and Watt steam engine to develop the power necessary for flight, and in this
[Line 188] he saw a possibility of practical result. It is worthy of note that in this connection he made mention of the forerunner of the modern
[Line 189] internal combustion engine; ‘The French,’ he said, ‘have lately shown the great power produced by igniting inflammable powders in closed
[Line 190] vessels, and several years ago an engine was made to work in this
[Line 191] country in a similar manner by inflammation of spirit of tar.’ In a subsequent paragraph of his monograph he anticipates almost exactly the construction of the Lenoir gas engine, which came into being more than
[Line 192] fifty-five years after his monograph was published.
[Line 193]  Certain experiments detailed in his work were made to ascertain the
[Line 194] size of the surface necessary for the support of any given weight.
[Line 195] He accepted a truism of to-day in pointing out that in any matters
[Line 196] connected with aerial investigation, theory and practice are as widely apart as the poles. Inclined at first to favour the helicopter
[Line 197] principle, he finally rejected this in favour of the plane, with
[Line 198] which he made numerous experiments. During these, he ascertained the
[Line 199] peculiar advantages of curved surfaces, and saw the necessity of
[Line 200] providing both vertical and horizontal rudders in order to admit of side steering as well as the control of ascent and descent, and for preserving equilibrium. He may be said to have anticipated the work of
[Line 201] Lilienthal and Pilcher, since he constructed and experimented with a fixed surface glider. ‘It was beautiful,’ he wrote concerning this, ‘to see this noble white bird sailing majestically from the top of a hill
[Line 202] to any given point of the plain below it with perfect steadiness and
[Line 203] safety, according to the set of its rudder, merely by its own weight, descending at an angle of about eight degrees with the horizon.’ 
[Line 204] [Illustration: Sir George Caley, Bart.
[Line 205] ‘The Father of British Aeronautics.’]
[Line 206] It is said that he once persuaded his gardener to trust himself in this
[Line 207] glider for a flight, but if Cayley himself ventured a flight in it he
[Line 208] has left no record of the fact. The following extract from his work,
[Line 209] _Aerial Navigation_, affords an instance of the thoroughness of his
[Line 210] investigations, and the concluding paragraph also shows his faith in the ultimate triumph of mankind in the matter of aerial flight:--
[Line 211] ‘The act of flying requires less exertion than from the appearance is supposed. Not having sufficient data to ascertain the exact degree of propelling power exerted by birds in the act of flying, it is uncertain
[Line 212] what degree of energy may be required in this respect for vessels of aerial navigation; yet when we consider the many hundreds of miles of
[Line 213] continued flight exerted by birds of passage, the idea of its being
[Line 214] only a small effort is greatly corroborated. To apply the power of the first mover to the greatest advantage in producing this effect is
[Line 215] a very material point. The mode universally adopted by Nature is the oblique waft of the wing. We have only to choose between the direct beat overtaking the velocity of the current, like the oar of a boat, or
[Line 216] one applied like the wing, in some assigned degree of obliquity to it. Suppose 35 feet per second to be the velocity of an aerial vehicle, the oar must be moved with this speed previous to its being able to receive
[Line 217] any resistance; then if it be only required to obtain a pressure of one-tenth of a lb. upon each square foot it must exceed the velocity of the current 7.3 feet per second. Hence its whole velocity must be 42.5 feet per second. Should the same surface be wafted downward like a
[Line 218] wing with the hinder edge inclined upward in an angle of about 50 deg.
[Line 219] 40 feet to the current it will overtake it at a velocity of 3.5 feet
[Line 220] per second; and as a slight unknown angle of resistance generates a lb.
[Line 221] pressure per square foot at this velocity, probably a waft of a little
[Line 222] more than 4 feet per second would produce this effect, one-tenth part of which would be the propelling power. The advantage of this mode of application compared with the former is rather more than ten to one.
[Line 223] ‘In continuing the general principles of aerial navigation, for the practice of the art, many mechanical difficulties present themselves
[Line 224] which require a considerable course of skilfully applied experiments
[Line 225] before they can be overcome; but, to a certain extent, the air has
[Line 226] already been made navigable, and no one who has seen the steadiness
[Line 227] with which weights to the amount of ten stone (including four stone,
[Line 228] the weight of the machine) hover in the air can doubt of the ultimate accomplishment of this object.’  This extract from his work gives but a faint idea of the amount of
[Line 229] research for which Cayley was responsible. He had the humility of the
[Line 230] true investigator in scientific problems, and so far as can be seen
[Line 231] was never guilty of the great fault of so many investigators in this
[Line 232] subject--that of making claims which he could not support. He was
[Line 233] content to do, and pass after having recorded his part, and although
[Line 234] nearly half a century had to pass between the time of his death and the first actual flight by means of power-driven planes, yet he may be said to have contributed very largely to the solution of the problem, and
[Line 235] his name will always rank high in the roll of the pioneers of flight. 
[Line 236] Practically contemporary with Cayley was Thomas Walker, concerning whom little is known save that he was a portrait painter of Hull, where was published his pamphlet on _The Art of Flying_ in 1810, a second and
[Line 237] amplified edition being produced, also in Hull, in 1831. The pamphlet, which has been reproduced _in extenso_ in the _Aeronautical Classics_ series published by the Royal Aeronautical Society, displays a curious
[Line 238] mixture of the true scientific spirit and colossal conceit. Walker appears to have been a man inclined to jump to conclusions, which carried him up to the edge of discovery and left him vacillating there.  The study of the two editions of his pamphlet side by side shows that
[Line 239] their author made considerable advances in the practicability of his designs in the 21 intervening years, though the drawings which
[Line 240] accompany the text in both editions fail to show anything really
[Line 241] capable of flight. The great point about Walker’s work as a whole is its suggestiveness; he did not hesitate to state that the ‘art’ of flying is as truly mechanical as that of rowing a boat, and he had some conception of the necessary mechanism, together with an absolute conviction that he knew all there was to be known. ‘Encouraged by the
[Line 242] public,’ he says, ‘I would not abandon my purpose of making still
[Line 243] further exertions to advance and complete an art, the discovery of the _true principles_ (the italics are Walker’s own) of which, I trust, I
[Line 244] can with certainty affirm to be my own.’
[Line 245]  The pamphlet begins with Walker’s admiration of the mechanism of flight as displayed by birds. ‘It is now almost twenty years,’ he says, ‘since
[Line 246] I was first led to think, by the study of birds and their means of
[Line 247] flying, that if an artificial machine were formed with wings in exact imitation of the mechanism of one of those beautiful living machines,
[Line 248] and applied in the very same way upon the air, there could be no doubt of its being made to fly, for it is an axiom in philosophy that the same cause will ever produce the same effect.’ With this he confesses
[Line 249] his inability to produce the said effect through lack of funds, though he clothes this delicately in the phrase ‘professional avocations and
[Line 250] other circumstances.’ Owing to this inability he published his designs that others might take advantage of them, prefacing his own researches with a list of the very early pioneers, and giving special mention to
[Line 251] Friar Bacon, Bishop Wilkins, and the Portuguese friar, De Guzman. But,
[Line 252] although he seems to suggest that others should avail themselves of his theoretical knowledge, there is a curious incompleteness about the designs accompanying his work, and about the work itself, which seems
[Line 253] to suggest that he had more knowledge to impart than he chose to make
[Line 254] public--or else that he came very near to complete solution of the
[Line 255] problem of flight, and stayed on the threshold without knowing it.
[Line 256]  After a dissertation upon the history and strength of the condor,
[Line 257] and on the differences between the weights of birds, he says: ‘The
[Line 258] following observations upon the wonderful difference in the weight of some birds, with their apparent means of supporting it in their flight, may tend to remove some prejudices against my plan from the minds of
[Line 259] some of my readers. The weight of the humming-bird is one drachm, that
[Line 260] of the condor not less than four stone. Now, if we reduce four stone
[Line 261] into drachms we shall find the condor is 14,336 times as heavy as the humming-bird. What an amazing disproportion of weight! Yet by the same mechanical use of its wings the condor can overcome the specific gravity of its body with as much ease as the little humming-bird. But
[Line 262] this is not all. We are informed that this enormous bird possesses a
[Line 263] power in its wings, so far exceeding what is necessary for its own conveyance through the air, that it can take up and fly away with a
[Line 264] whole sheep in its talons, with as much ease as an eagle would carry off, in the same manner, a hare or a rabbit. This we may readily give credit to, from the known fact of our little kestrel and the
[Line 265] sparrowhawk frequently flying off with a partridge, which is nearly three times the weight of these rapacious little birds.’ 
[Line 266] After a few more observations he arrives at the following conclusion:
[Line 267] ‘By attending to the progressive increase in the weight of birds, from
[Line 268] the delicate little humming-bird up to the huge condor, we clearly discover that the addition of a few ounces, pounds, or stones, is no
[Line 269] obstacle to the art of flying; the specific weight of birds avails nothing, for by their possessing wings large enough, and sufficient
[Line 270] power to work them, they can accomplish the means of flying equally
[Line 271] well upon all the various scales and dimensions which we see in nature.
[Line 272] Such being a fact, in the name of reason and philosophy why shall not man, with a pair of artificial wings, large enough, and with sufficient power to strike them upon the air, be able to produce the same effect?’ 
[Line 273] Walker asserted definitely and with good ground that muscular effort applied without mechanism is insufficient for human flight, but he states that if an aeronautical boat were constructed so that a man could sit in it in the same manner as when rowing, such a man would be able to bring into play his whole bodily strength for the purpose
[Line 274] of flight, and at the same time would be able to get an additional advantage by exerting his strength upon a lever. At first he concluded there must be expansion of wings large enough to resist in a sufficient degree the specific gravity of whatever is attached to them, but in
[Line 275] the second edition of his work he altered this to ‘expansion of flat
[Line 276] passive surfaces large enough to reduce the force of gravity so as to float the machine upon the air with the man in it.’ The second
[Line 277] requisite is strength enough to strike the wings with sufficient force to complete the buoyancy and give a projectile motion to the machine.
[Line 278] Given these two requisites, Walker states definitely that flying must
[Line 279] be accomplished simply by muscular exertion. ‘If we are secure of these
[Line 280] two requisites, and I am very confident we are, we may calculate upon the success of flight with as much certainty as upon our walking.’  Walker appears to have gained some confidence from the experiments of a certain M. Degen, a watchmaker of Vienna, who, according to the
[Line 281] _Monthly Magazine_ of September, 1809, invented a machine by means of
[Line 282] which a person might raise himself into the air. The said machine,
[Line 283] according to the magazine, was formed of two parachutes which might be folded up or extended at pleasure, while the person who worked them was placed in the centre. This account, however, was rather misleading,
[Line 284] for the magazine carefully avoided mention of a balloon to which the inventor fixed his wings or parachutes. Walker, knowing nothing of the balloon, concluded that Degen actually raised himself in the air,
[Line 285] though he is doubtful of the assertion that Degen managed to fly in
[Line 286] various directions, especially against the wind.
[Line 287]  Walker, after considering Degen and all his works, proceeds to detail
[Line 288] his own directions for the construction of a flying machine, these
[Line 289] being as follows: ‘Make a car of as light material as possible, but with sufficient strength to support a man in it; provide a pair of wings about four feet each in length; let them be horizontally expanded and fastened upon the top edge of each side of the car, with two
[Line 290] joints each, so as to admit of a vertical motion to the wings, which
[Line 291] motion may be effected by a man sitting and working an upright lever in
[Line 292] the middle of the car. Extend in the front of the car a flat surface of silk, which must be stretched out and kept fixed in a passive state;
[Line 293] there must be the same fixed behind the car; these two surfaces must
[Line 294] be perfectly equal in length and breadth and large enough to cover a
[Line 295] sufficient quantity of air to support the whole weight as nearly in equilibrium as possible, thus we shall have a great sustaining power
[Line 296] in those passive surfaces and the active wings will propel the car
[Line 297] forward.’
[Line 298] A description of how to launch this car is subsequently given: ‘It becomes necessary,’ says the theorist, ‘that I should give directions
[Line 299] how it may be launched upon the air, which may be done by various means; perhaps the following method may be found to answer as well as
[Line 300] any: Fix a poll upright in the earth, about twenty feet in height, with two open collars to admit another poll to slide upwards through them; let there be a sliding platform made fast upon the top of the sliding poll; place the car with a man in it upon the platform, then
[Line 301] raise the platform to the height of about thirty feet by means of the sliding poll, let the sliding poll and platform suddenly fall down, the car will then be left upon the air, and by its pressing the air
[Line 302] a projectile force will instantly propel the car forward; the man in the car must then strike the active wings briskly upon the air, which will so increase the projectile force as to become superior to the
[Line 303] force of gravitation, and if he inclines his weight a little backward, the projectile impulse will drive the car forward in an ascending direction. When the car is brought to a sufficient altitude to clear the tops of hills, trees, buildings, etc., the man, by sitting a little
[Line 304] forward on his seat, will then bring the wings upon a horizontal plane,
[Line 305] and by continuing the action of the wings he will be impelled forward in that direction. To descend, he must desist from striking the wings, and hold them on a level with their joints; the car will then gradually come down, and when it is within five or six feet of the ground the man
[Line 306] must instantly strike the wings downwards, and sit as far back as he
[Line 307] can; he will by this means check the projectile force, and cause the car to alight very gently with a retrograde motion. The car, when up in the air, may be made to turn to the right or to the left by forcing out one of the fins, having one about eighteen inches long placed vertically on each side of the car for that purpose, or perhaps merely by the man inclining the weight of his body to one side.’  Having stated how the thing is to be done, Walker is careful to explain that when it is done there will be in it some practical use, notably
[Line 308] in respect of the conveyance of mails and newspapers, or the saving of life at sea, or for exploration, etc. It might even reduce the number of horses kept by man for his use, by means of which a large amount of land might be set free for the growth of food for human consumption.
[Line 309]  At the end of his work Walker admits the idea of steam power for
[Line 310] driving a flying machine in place of simple human exertion, but he,
[Line 311] like Cayley, saw a drawback to this in the weight of the necessary engine. On the whole, he concluded, navigation of the air by means of engine power would be mostly confined to the construction of navigable
[Line 312] balloons. 
[Line 313] As already noted, Walker’s work is not over practical, and the foregoing extract includes the most practical part of it; the rest is
[Line 314] a series of dissertations on bird flight, in which, evidently, the
[Line 315] portrait painter’s observations were far less thorough than those
[Line 316] of da Vinci or Borelli. Taken on the whole, Walker was a man with a hobby; he devoted to it much time and thought, but it remained a hobby,
[Line 317] nevertheless. His observations have proved useful enough to give him a place among the early students of flight, but a great drawback to his
[Line 318] work is the lack of practical experiment, by means of which alone real
[Line 319] advance could be made; for, as Cayley admitted, theory and practice are
[Line 320] very widely separated in the study of aviation, and the whole history
[Line 321] of flight is a matter of unexpected results arising from scarcely foreseen causes, together with experiment as patient as daring.
[Line 322]  
[Line 323]  IV  THE MIDDLE NINETEENTH CENTURY
[Line 324]  Both Cayley and Walker were theorists, though Cayley supported his
[Line 325] theoretical work with enough of practice to show that he studied
[Line 326] along right lines; a little after his time there came practical men
[Line 327] who brought to being the first machine which actually flew by the
[Line 328] application of power. Before their time, however, mention must be made
[Line 329] of the work of George Pocock of Bristol, who, somewhere about 1840,
[Line 330] invented what was described as a ‘kite carriage,’ a vehicle which carried a number of persons, and obtained its motive power from a large
[Line 331] kite. It is on record that, in the year 1846, one of these carriages conveyed sixteen people from Bristol to London. Another device of
[Line 332] Pocock’s was what he called a ‘buoyant sail,’ which was in effect
[Line 333] a man-lifting kite, and by means of which a passenger was actually raised 100 yards from the ground, while the inventor’s son scaled a
[Line 334] cliff 200 feet in height by means of one of these ‘buoyant sails.’
[Line 335] This constitutes the first definitely recorded experiment in the use of man-lifting kites. _A History of the Charvolant or Kite-Carriage_, published in London in 1851, states that ‘an experiment of a bold
[Line 336] and very novel character was made upon an extensive down, where a
[Line 337] large wagon with a considerable load was drawn along, whilst this
[Line 338] huge machine at the same time carried an observer aloft in the air, realising almost the romance of flying.’ 
[Line 339] Experimenting, two years after the appearance of the ‘kite-carriage,’
[Line 340] on the helicopter principle, W. H. Phillips constructed a model
[Line 341] machine which weighed two pounds; this was fitted with revolving fans,
[Line 342] driven by the combustion of charcoal, nitre, and gypsum, producing steam which, discharging into the air, caused the fans to revolve.
[Line 343] The inventor stated that ‘all being arranged, the steam was up in a few seconds, when the whole apparatus spun around like any top, and
[Line 344] mounted into the air faster than a bird; to what height it ascended I had no means of ascertaining; the distance travelled was across two fields, where, after a long search, I found the machine minus the wings, which had been torn off in contact with the ground.’ This could hardly be described as successful flight, but it was an advance in the construction of machines on the helicopter principle, and it was the first steam-driven model of the type which actually flew. The invention, however, was not followed up.  After Phillips, we come to the great figures of the middle nineteenth century, W. S. Henson and John Stringfellow. Cayley had shown, in 1809, how success might be attained by developing the idea of the plane surface so driven as to take advantage of the resistance offered by the air, and Henson, who as early as 1840 was experimenting with model
[Line 345] gliders and light steam engines, evolved and patented an idea for something very nearly resembling the monoplane of the early twentieth
[Line 346] century. His patent, No. 9478, of the year 1842, explains the principle of the machine as follows:--
[Line 347]  ‘In order that the description hereafter given may be rendered clear,
[Line 348] I will first shortly explain the principle on which the machine is constructed. If any light and flat or nearly flat article be projected or thrown edgewise in a slightly inclined position, the same will
[Line 349] rise on the air till the force exerted is expended, when the article so thrown or projected will descend; and it will readily be conceived that, if the article so projected or thrown possessed in itself a
[Line 350] continuous power or force equal to that used in throwing or projecting it, the article would continue to ascend so long as the forward part
[Line 351] of the surface was upwards in respect to the hinder part, and that such article, when the power was stopped, or when the inclination was reversed, would descend by gravity aided by the force of the power
[Line 352] contained in the article, if the power be continued, thus imitating the
[Line 353] flight of a bird.  [Illustration: Henson’s proposed flying machine.] 
[Line 354] [Illustration: Stringfellow’s power-driven model--the first model to achieve engine-driven flight.]  Now, the first part of my invention consists of an apparatus so
[Line 355] constructed as to offer a very extended surface or plane of a light yet strong construction, which will have the same relation to the general
[Line 356] machine which the extended wings of a bird have to the body when a
[Line 357] bird is skimming in the air; but in place of the movement or power for onward progress being obtained by movement of the extended surface
[Line 358] or plane, as is the case with the wings of birds, I apply suitable
[Line 359] paddle-wheels or other proper mechanical propellers worked by a steam
[Line 360] or other sufficiently light engine, and thus obtain the requisite power for onward movement to the plane or extended surface; and in
[Line 361] order to give control as to the upward and downward direction of such
[Line 362] a machine I apply a tail to the extended surface which is capable of being inclined or raised, so that when the power is acting to propel the machine, by inclining the tail upwards, the resistance offered
[Line 363] by the air will cause the machine to rise on the air; and, on the
[Line 364] contrary, when the inclination of the tail is reversed, the machine will immediately be propelled downwards, and pass through a plane more or less inclined to the horizon as the inclination of the tail is
[Line 365] greater or less; and in order to guide the machine as to the lateral
[Line 366] direction which it shall take, I apply a vertical rudder or second
[Line 367] tail, and, according as the same is inclined in one direction or the
[Line 368] other, so will be the direction of the machine.’  The machine in question was very large, and differed very little from
[Line 369] the modern monoplane; the materials were to be spars of bamboo and hollow wood, with diagonal wire bracing. The surface of the planes was
[Line 370] to amount to 4,500 square feet, and the tail, triangular in form (here
[Line 371] modern practice diverges) was to be 1,500 square feet. The inventor estimated that there would be a sustaining power of half a pound per square foot, and the driving power was to be supplied by a steam engine
[Line 372] of 25 to 30 horse-power, driving two six-bladed propellers. Henson was largely dependent on Stringfellow for many details of his design, more especially with regard to the construction of the engine.
[Line 373] The publication of the patent attracted a great amount of public attention, and the illustrations in contemporary journals, representing the machine flying over the pyramids and the Channel, anticipated fact by sixty years and more; the scientific world was divided, as it
[Line 374] was up to the actual accomplishment of flight, as to the value of the
[Line 375] invention. 
[Line 376] Stringfellow and Henson became associated, after the conception of
[Line 377] their design, with an attorney named Colombine, and a Mr Marriott, and between the four of them a project grew for putting the whole thing on
[Line 378] a commercial basis--Henson and Stringfellow were to supply the idea; Marriott, knowing a member of Parliament, would be useful in getting a
[Line 379] company incorporated, and Colombine would look after the purely legal side of the business. Thus an application was made by Mr Roebuck, Marriott’s M.P., for an act of incorporation for ‘The Aerial Steam
[Line 380] Transit Company,’ Roebuck moving to bring in the bill on the 24th of March, 1843. The prospectus, calling for funds for the development of
[Line 381] the invention, makes interesting reading at this stage of aeronautical development; it was as follows:--    PROPOSAL. 
[Line 382]   For subscriptions of sums of £100, in furtherance of an
[Line 383]   Extraordinary Invention not at present safe to be developed by   securing the necessary Patents, for which three times the sum
[Line 384]   advanced, namely, £300, is conditionally guaranteed for each   subscription on February 1, 1844, in case of the anticipations
[Line 385]   being realised, with the option of the subscribers being   shareholders for the large amount if so desired, but not otherwise. 
[Line 386]        *       *       *       *       *
[Line 387]   An Invention has recently been discovered, which if ultimately   successful will be without parallel even in the age which   introduced to the world the wonderful effects of gas and of steam.    The discovery is of that peculiar nature, so simple in principle
[Line 388]   yet so perfect in all the ingredients required for complete and   permanent success, that to promulgate it at present would wholly   defeat its development by the immense competition which would
[Line 389]   ensue, and the views of the originator be entirely frustrated.
[Line 390]   This work, the result of years of labour and study, presents a
[Line 391]   wonderful instance of the adaptation of laws long since proved
[Line 392]   to the scientific world combined with established principles so   judiciously and carefully arranged, as to produce a discovery   perfect in all its parts and alike in harmony with the laws of
[Line 393]   Nature and of science. 
[Line 394]   The Invention has been subjected to several tests and examinations
[Line 395]   and the results are most satisfactory, so much so that nothing
[Line 396]   but the completion of the undertaking is required to determine   its practical operation, which being once established its utility
[Line 397]   is undoubted, as it would be a necessary possession of every
[Line 398]   empire, and it were hardly too much to say, of every individual of   competent means in the civilised world.
[Line 399]   Its qualities and capabilities are so vast that it were impossible
[Line 400]   and, even if possible, unsafe to develop them further, but some
[Line 401]   idea may be formed from the fact that as a preliminary measure   patents in Great Britain, Ireland, Scotland, the Colonies, France,
[Line 402]   Belgium, and the United States, and every other country where   protection to the first discoveries of an Invention is granted,
[Line 403]   will of necessity be immediately obtained, and by the time these
[Line 404]   are perfected, which it is estimated will be in the month of   February, the Invention will be fit for Public Trial, but until the   Patents are sealed any further disclosure would be most dangerous
[Line 405]   to the principle on which it is based.
[Line 406]   Under these circumstances, it is proposed to raise an immediate   sum of £2,000 in furtherance of the Projector’s views, and as
[Line 407]   some protection to the parties who may embark in the matter, that   this is not a visionary plan for objects imperfectly considered,   Mr Colombine, to whom the secret has been confided, has allowed
[Line 408]   his name to be used on the occasion, and who will if referred   to corroborate this statement, and convince any inquirer of the
[Line 409]   reasonable prospects of large pecuniary results following the   development of the Invention. 
[Line 410]   It is, therefore, intended to raise the sum of £2,000 in twenty   sums of £100 each (of which any subscriber may take one or more not
[Line 411]   exceeding five in number to be held by any individual) the amount
[Line 412]   of which is to be paid into the hands of Mr Colombine as General
[Line 413]   Manager of the concern to be by him appropriated in procuring the   several Patents and providing the expenses incidental to the works   in progress. For each of which sums of £100 it is intended and   agreed that twelve months after the 1st February next, the several
[Line 414]   parties subscribing shall receive as an equivalent for the risk to
[Line 415]   be run the sum of £300 for each of the sums of £100 now subscribed,   provided when the time arrives the Patents shall be found to answer
[Line 416]   the purposes intended.    As full and complete success is alone looked to, no moderate or   imperfect benefit is to be anticipated, but the work, if it once
[Line 417]   passes the necessary ordeal, to which inventions of every kind
[Line 418]   must be first subject, will then be regarded by every one as the
[Line 419]   most astonishing discovery of modern times; no half success can
[Line 420]   follow, and therefore the full nature of the risk is immediately   ascertained.
[Line 421]   The intention is to work and prove the Patent by collective instead   of individual aid as less hazardous at first and more advantageous   in the result for the Inventor, as well as others, by having the
[Line 422]   interest of several engaged in aiding one common object--the   development of a Great Plan. The failure is not feared, yet as   perfect success might, by possibility, not ensue, it is necessary   to provide for that result, and the parties concerned make it a
[Line 423]   condition that no return of the subscribed money shall be required,
[Line 424]   if the Patents shall by any unforeseen circumstances not be capable
[Line 425]   of being worked at all; against which, the first application of
[Line 426]   the money subscribed, that of securing the Patents, affords a
[Line 427]   reasonable security, as no one without solid grounds would think of
[Line 428]   such an expenditure. 
[Line 429]   It is perfectly needless to state that no risk or responsibility of
[Line 430]   any kind can arise beyond the payment of the sum to be subscribed   under any circumstances whatever.
[Line 431]   As soon as the Patents shall be perfected and proved it is
[Line 432]   contemplated, so far as may be found practicable, to further the
[Line 433]   great object in view a Company shall be formed but respecting which   it is unnecessary to state further details, than that a preference
[Line 434]   will be given to all those persons who now subscribe, and to whom
[Line 435]   shares shall be appropriated according to the larger amount (being   three times the sum to be paid by each person) contemplated to   be returned as soon as the success of the Invention shall have   been established, at their option, or the money paid, whereby the   Subscriber will have the means of either withdrawing with a large   pecuniary benefit, or by continuing his interest in the concern,
[Line 436]   lay the foundation for participating in the immense benefit which   must follow the success of the plan.
[Line 437]    It is not pretended to conceal that the project is a
[Line 438]   speculation--all parties believe that perfect success, and thence
[Line 439]   incalculable advantage of every kind, will follow to every   individual joining in this great undertaking; but the Gentlemen   engaged in it wish that no concealment of the consequences, perfect   success, or possible failure, should in the slightest degree
[Line 440]   be inferred. They believe this will prove the germ of a mighty
[Line 441]   work, and in that belief call for the operation of others with no   visionary object, but a legitimate one before them, to attain that   point where perfect success will be secured from their combined
[Line 442]   exertions.
[Line 443]    All applications to be made to D. E. Colombine, Esquire, 8 Carlton   Chambers, Regent Street. 
[Line 444] The applications did not materialise, as was only to be expected in
[Line 445] view of the vagueness of the proposals. Colombine did some advertising, and Mr Roebuck expressed himself as unwilling to proceed further in the venture. Henson experimented with models to a certain extent, while
[Line 446] Stringfellow looked for funds for the construction of a full-sized
[Line 447] monoplane. In November of 1843 he suggested that he and Henson should
[Line 448] construct a large model out of their own funds. On Henson’s suggestion Colombine and Marriott were bought out as regards the original patent,
[Line 449] and Stringfellow and Henson entered into an agreement and set to work. 
[Line 450] Their work is briefly described in a little pamphlet by F. J. Stringfellow, entitled _A few Remarks on what has been done with
[Line 451] screw-propelled Aeroplane Machines from 1809 to 1892_. The author writes with regard to the work that his father and Henson undertook:--  ‘They commenced the construction of a small model operated by a spring,
[Line 452] and laid down the larger model 20 ft. from tip to tip of planes, 3½ ft.
[Line 453] wide, giving 70 ft. of sustaining surface, about 10 more in the tail.
[Line 454] The making of this model required great consideration; various supports
[Line 455] for the wings were tried, so as to combine lightness with firmness,
[Line 456] strength and rigidity.
[Line 457] ‘The planes were staid from three sets of fish-shaped masts, and rigged square and firm by flat steel rigging. The engine and boiler were put in the car to drive two screw-propellers, right and left-handed,
[Line 458] 3 ft. in diameter, with four blades each, occupying three-quarters
[Line 459] of the area of the circumference, set at an angle of 60 degrees. A
[Line 460] considerable time was spent in perfecting the motive power. Compressed
[Line 461] air was tried and abandoned. Tappets, cams, and eccentrics were all
[Line 462] tried, to work the slide valve, to obtain the best results. The piston rod of engine passed through both ends of the cylinder, and with long
[Line 463] connecting rods worked direct on the crank of the propellers. From memorandum of experiments still preserved the following is a copy of
[Line 464] one: June, 27th, 1845, water 50 ozs., spirit 10 ozs., lamp lit 8.45, gauge moves 8.46, engine started 8.48 (100 lb. pressure), engine
[Line 465] stopped 8.57, worked 9 minutes, 2,288 revolutions, average 254 per
[Line 466] minute. No priming, 40 ozs. water consumed, propulsion (thrust of propellers), 5 lbs. 4½ ozs. at commencement, steady, 4 lbs. ½ oz., 57
[Line 467] revolutions to 1 oz. water, steam cut off one-third from beginning. 
[Line 468] ‘The diameter of cylinder of engine was 1½ inch, length of stroke 3 inches.  ‘In the meantime an engine was also made for the smaller model, and a
[Line 469] wing action tried, but with poor results. The time was mostly devoted
[Line 470] to the larger model, and in 1847 a tent was erected on Bala Down, about two miles from Chard, and the model taken up one night by the
[Line 471] workmen. The experiments were not so favourable as was expected. The
[Line 472] machine could not support itself for any distance, but, when launched
[Line 473] off, gradually descended, although the power and surface should have been ample; indeed, according to latest calculations, the thrust should have carried more than three times the weight, for there was a thrust
[Line 474] of 5 lbs. from the propellers, and a surface of over 70 square feet to sustain under 30 lbs., but necessary speed was lacking.’
[Line 475] [Illustration: Stringfellow’s model triplane, 1868.]
[Line 476] Stringfellow himself explained the failure as follows:--
[Line 477] ‘There stood our aerial protégée in all her purity--too delicate,
[Line 478] too fragile, too beautiful for this rough world; at least those were
[Line 479] my ideas at the time, but little did I think how soon it was to be realised. I soon found, before I had time to introduce the spark, a
[Line 480] drooping in the wings, a flagging in all the parts. In less than ten minutes the machine was saturated with wet from a deposit of dew, so that anything like a trial was impossible by night. I did not consider we could get the silk tight and rigid enough. Indeed, the framework altogether was too weak. The steam-engine was the best part. Our
[Line 481] want of success was not for want of power or sustaining surface, but for want of proper adaptation of the means to the end of the various parts.’ 
[Line 482] Henson, who had spent a considerable amount of money in these
[Line 483] experimental constructions, consoled himself for failure by venturing into matrimony; in 1849 he went to America, leaving Stringfellow to
[Line 484] continue experimenting alone. From 1846 to 1848 Stringfellow worked on what is really an epoch-making item in the history of aeronautics--the first engine-driven aeroplane which actually flew. The machine in
[Line 485] question had a 10 foot span, and was 2 ft. across in the widest part
[Line 486] of the wing; the length of tail was 3 ft. 6 ins., and the span of tail
[Line 487] in the widest part 22 ins., the total sustaining area being about 14
[Line 488] sq. ft. The motive power consisted of an engine with a cylinder of
[Line 489] three-quarter inch diameter and a two-inch stroke; between this and the crank shaft was a bevelled gear giving three revolutions of the
[Line 490] propellers to every stroke of the engine; the propellers, right and
[Line 491] left screw, were four-bladed and 16 inches in diameter. The total
[Line 492] weight of the model with engine was 8 lbs. Its successful flight is ascribed to the fact that Stringfellow curved the wings, giving them
[Line 493] rigid front edges and flexible trailing edges, as suggested long before
[Line 494] both by Da Vinci and Borelli, but never before put into practice.
[Line 495] Mr F. J. Stringfellow, in the pamphlet quoted above, gives the best account of the flight of this model: ‘My father had constructed another small model which was finished early in 1848, and having the loan of
[Line 496] a long room in a disused lace factory, early in June the small model was moved there for experiments. The room was about 22 yards long and from 10 to 12 ft. high.... The inclined wire for starting the machine occupied less than half the length of the room and left space at the
[Line 497] end for the machine to clear the floor. In the first experiment the tail was set at too high an angle, and the machine rose too rapidly on leaving the wire. After going a few yards it slid back as if coming down an inclined plane, at such an angle that the point of the tail
[Line 498] struck the ground and was broken. The tail was repaired and set at a
[Line 499] smaller angle. The steam was again got up, and the machine started
[Line 500] down the wire, and, upon reaching the point of self-detachment, it
[Line 501] gradually rose until it reached the farther end of the room, striking a
[Line 502] hole in the canvas placed to stop it. In experiments the machine flew
[Line 503] well, when rising as much as one in seven. The late Rev. J. Riste,
[Line 504] Esq., lace manufacturer, Northcote Spicer, Esq., J. Toms, Esq., and
[Line 505] others witnessed experiments. Mr Marriatt, late of the San Francisco _News Letter_ brought down from London Mr Ellis, the then lessee of Cremorne Gardens, Mr Partridge, and Lieutenant Gale, the aeronaut, to witness experiments. Mr Ellis offered to construct a covered way at Cremorne for experiments. Mr Stringfellow repaired to Cremorne, but not
[Line 506] much better accommodations than he had at home were provided, owing
[Line 507] to unfulfilled engagement as to room. Mr Stringfellow was preparing for departure when a party of gentlemen unconnected with the Gardens
[Line 508] begged to see an experiment, and finding them able to appreciate his endeavours, he got up steam and started the model down the wire. When it arrived at the spot where it should leave the wire it appeared to
[Line 509] meet with some obstruction, and threatened to come to the ground, but
[Line 510] it soon recovered itself and darted off in as fair a flight as it was possible to make at a distance of about 40 yards, where it was stopped by the canvas.  ‘Having now demonstrated the practicability of making a steam-engine fly, and finding nothing but a pecuniary loss and little honour, this experimenter rested for a long time, satisfied with what he had
[Line 511] effected. The subject, however, had to him special charms, and he still
[Line 512] contemplated the renewal of his experiments.’
[Line 513]  It appears that Stringfellow’s interest did not revive sufficiently for the continuance of the experiments until the founding of the
[Line 514] Aeronautical Society of Great Britain in 1866. Wenham’s paper on Aerial Locomotion read at the first meeting of the Society, which was held at the Society of Arts under the Presidency of the Duke of Argyll, was the means of bringing Stringfellow back into the field. It was
[Line 515] Wenham’s suggestion, in the first place, that monoplane design should
[Line 516] be abandoned for the superposition of planes; acting on this suggestion
[Line 517] Stringfellow constructed a model triplane, and also designed a steam
[Line 518] engine of slightly over one horse-power, and a one horse-power copper
[Line 519] boiler and fire box which, although capable of sustaining a pressure of
[Line 520] 500 lbs. to the square inch, weighed only about 40 lbs. 
[Line 521] Both the engine and the triplane model were exhibited at the first Aeronautical Exhibition held at the Crystal Palace in 1868. The
[Line 522] triplane had a supporting surface of 28 sq. ft.; inclusive of engine, boiler, fuel, and water its total weight was under 12 lbs. The engine
[Line 523] worked two 21 in. propellers at 600 revolutions per minute, and
[Line 524] developed 100 lbs. steam pressure in five minutes, yielding one-third horse-power. Since no free flight was allowed in the Exhibition, owing to danger from fire, the triplane was suspended from a wire in the nave of the building, and it was noted that, when running along the wire, the model made a perceptible lift. 
[Line 525] A prize of £100 was awarded to the steam engine as the lightest steam engine in proportion to its power. The engine and model together may be reckoned as Stringfellow’s best achievement. He used his £100 in
[Line 526] preparation for further experiments, but he was now an old man, and his work was practically done. Both the triplane and the engine were
[Line 527] eventually bought for the Washington Museum; Stringfellow’s earlier models, together with those constructed by him in conjunction with
[Line 528] Henson, remain in this country in the Victoria and Albert Museum. 
[Line 529] John Stringfellow died on December 13th, 1883. His place in the history
[Line 530] of aeronautics is at least equal to that of Cayley, and it may be
[Line 531] said that he laid the foundation of such work as was subsequently accomplished by Maxim, Langley, and their fellows. It was the coming
[Line 532] of the internal combustion engine that rendered flight practicable, and had this prime mover been available in John Stringfellow’s day
[Line 533] the Wright brothers’ achievement might have been antedated by half a century.
[Line 534]  V
[Line 535]  WENHAM, LE BRIS, AND SOME OTHERS
[Line 536]  There are few outstanding events in the development of aeronautics
[Line 537] between Stringfellow’s final achievement and the work of such men as Lilienthal, Pilcher, Montgomery, and their kind; in spite of this, the
[Line 538] later middle decades of the nineteenth century witnessed a considerable amount of spade work both in England and in France, the two countries
[Line 539] which led in the way in aeronautical development until Lilienthal gave honour to Germany, and Langley and Montgomery paved the way for the Wright Brothers in America. 
[Line 540] Two abortive attempts characterised the sixties of last century in France. As regards the first of these, it was carried out by three
[Line 541] men, Nadar, Ponton d’Amecourt, and De la Landelle, who conceived the idea of a full-sized helicopter machine. D’Amecourt exhibited a steam
[Line 542] model, constructed in 1865, at the Aeronautical Society’s Exhibition in
[Line 543] 1868. The engine was aluminium with cylinders of bronze, driving two screws placed one above the other and rotating in opposite directions, but the power was not sufficient to lift the model. De la Landelle’s
[Line 544] principal achievement consisted in the publication in 1863 of a book
[Line 545] entitled _Aviation_, which has a certain historical value; he got out
[Line 546] several designs for large machines on the helicopter principle, but did little more until the three combined in the attempt to raise funds
[Line 547] for the construction of their full-sized machine. Since the funds were not forthcoming, Nadar took to ballooning as the means of raising money; apparently he found this substitute for real flight sufficiently
[Line 548] interesting to divert him from the study of the helicopter principle, for the experiment went no further.
[Line 549] The other experimenter of this period, one Count d’Esterno, took out a patent in 1864 for a soaring machine which allowed for alteration of the angle of incidence of the wings in the manner that was subsequently carried out by the Wright Brothers. It was not until 1883 that any attempt was made to put this patent to practical use, and, as the
[Line 550] inventor died while it was under construction, it was never completed.
[Line 551] D’Esterno was also responsible for the production of a work entitled
[Line 552] _Du Vol des Oiseaux_, which is a very remarkable study of the flight of birds.
[Line 553] Mention has already been made of the founding of the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain, which, since 1918, has been the Royal
[Line 554] Aeronautical Society. 1866 witnessed the first meeting of the Society
[Line 555] under the Presidency of the Duke of Argyll, when in June, at the Society of Arts, Francis Herbert Wenham read his now classic paper _Aerial Locomotion_. Certain quotations from this will show how clearly
[Line 556] Wenham had thought out the problems connected with flight. 
[Line 557] ‘The first subject for consideration is the proportion of surface
[Line 558] to weight, and their combined effect in descending perpendicularly through the atmosphere. The datum is here based upon the consideration
[Line 559] of safety, for it may sometimes be needful for a living being to drop
[Line 560] passively, without muscular effort. One square foot of sustaining surface for every pound of the total weight will be sufficient for
[Line 561] security.  ‘According to Smeaton’s table of atmospheric resistances, to produce a force of one pound on a square foot, the wind must move against the plane (or which is the same thing, the plane against the wind), at the rate of twenty-two feet per second, or 1,320 feet per minute, equal to
[Line 562] fifteen miles per hour. The resistance of the air will now balance the
[Line 563] weight on the descending surface, and, consequently, it cannot exceed
[Line 564] that speed. Now, twenty-two feet per second is the velocity acquired at the end of a fall of eight feet--a height from which a well-knit man or
[Line 565] animal may leap down without much risk of injury. Therefore, if a man
[Line 566] with parachute weigh together 143 lbs., spreading the same number of
[Line 567] square feet of surface contained in a circle fourteen and a half feet in diameter, he will descend at perhaps an unpleasant velocity, but with safety to life and limb.  ‘It is a remarkable fact how this proportion of wing-surface to weight extends throughout a great variety of the flying portion of
[Line 568] the animal kingdom, even down to hornets, bees, and other insects.
[Line 569] In some instances, however, as in the gallinaceous tribe, including pheasants, this area is somewhat exceeded, but they are known to be very poor fliers. Residing as they do chiefly on the ground, their wings are only required for short distances, or for raising them or
[Line 570] easing their descent from their roosting-places in forest trees, the
[Line 571] shortness of their wings preventing them from taking extended flights. The wing-surface of the common swallow is rather more than in the ratio
[Line 572] of two square feet per pound, but having also great length of pinion,
[Line 573] it is both swift and enduring in its flight. When on a rapid course this bird is in the habit of furling its wings into a narrow compass. The greater extent of surface is probably needful for the continual
[Line 574] variations of speed and instant stoppages for obtaining its insect food.
[Line 575] ‘On the other hand, there are some birds, particularly of the duck tribe, whose wing-surface but little exceeds half a square foot, or seventy-two inches per pound, yet they may be classed among the strongest and swiftest of fliers. A weight of one pound, suspended
[Line 576] from an area of this extent, would acquire a velocity due to a fall of
[Line 577] sixteen feet--a height sufficient for the destruction or injury of most
[Line 578] animals. But when the plane is urged forward horizontally, in a manner analogous to the wings of a bird during flight, the sustaining power is
[Line 579] greatly influenced by the form and arrangement of the surface.
[Line 580] ‘In the case of perpendicular descent, as a parachute, the sustaining
[Line 581] effect will be much the same, whatever the figure of the outline of the
[Line 582] superficies may be, and a circle perhaps affords the best resistance of
[Line 583] any. Take, for example, a circle of twenty square feet (as possessed by the pelican) loaded with as many pounds. This, as just stated, will limit the rate of perpendicular descent to 1,320 feet per minute. But instead of a circle sixty-one inches in diameter, if the area is bounded by a parallelogram ten feet long by two feet broad, and whilst
[Line 584] at perfect freedom to descend perpendicularly, let a force be applied exactly in a horizontal direction, so as to carry it edgeways, with the long side foremost, at a forward speed of thirty miles per hour--just double that of its passive descent: the rate of fall under these
[Line 585] conditions will be decreased most remarkably, probably to less than one-fifteenth part, or eighty-eight feet per minute, or one mile per
[Line 586] hour.’
[Line 587]  And again: ‘It has before been shown how utterly inadequate the mere perpendicular impulse of a plane is found to be in supporting a weight,
[Line 588] when there is no horizontal motion at the time. There is no material
[Line 589] weight of air to be acted upon, and it yields to the slightest force,
[Line 590] however great the velocity of impulse may be. On the other hand,
[Line 591] suppose that a large bird, in full flight, can make forty miles per
[Line 592] hour, or 3,520 feet per minute, and performs one stroke per second. Now, during every fractional portion of that stroke, the wing is acting upon and obtaining an impulse from a fresh and undisturbed body of air; and if the vibration of the wing is limited to an arc of two
[Line 593] feet, this by no means represents the small force of action that would
[Line 594] be obtained when in a stationary position, for the impulse is secured upon a stratum of fifty-eight feet in length of air at each stroke. So that the conditions of weight of air for obtaining support equally well apply to weight of air and its reaction in producing forward impulse. 
[Line 595] ‘So necessary is the acquirement of this horizontal speed, even in
[Line 596] commencing flight, that most heavy birds, when possible, rise against the wind, and even run at the top of their speed to make their
[Line 597] wings available, as in the example of the eagle, mentioned at the commencement of this paper. It is stated that the Arabs, on horseback,
[Line 598] can approach near enough to spear these birds, when on the plain,
[Line 599] before they are able to rise; their habit is to perch on an eminence,
[Line 600] where possible.  ‘The tail of a bird is not necessary for flight. A pigeon can fly
[Line 601] perfectly with this appendage cut short off; it probably performs an important function in steering, for it is to be remarked, that most
[Line 602] birds that have either to pursue or evade pursuit are amply provided
[Line 603] with this organ. 
[Line 604] ‘The foregoing reasoning is based upon facts, which tend to show that the flight of the largest and heaviest of all birds is really performed with but a small amount of force, and that man is endowed
[Line 605] with sufficient muscular power to enable him also to take individual and extended flights, and that success is probably only involved in a question of suitable mechanical adaptations. But if the wings are
[Line 606] to be modelled in imitation of natural examples, but very little
[Line 607] consideration will serve to demonstrate its utter impracticability when applied in these forms.’ 
[Line 608] Thus Wenham, one of the best theorists of his age. The Society with which this paper connects his name has done work, between that time
[Line 609] and the present, of which the importance cannot be overestimated, and has been of the greatest value in the development of aeronautics,
[Line 610] both in theory and experiment. The objects of the Society are to give
[Line 611] a stronger impulse to the scientific study of aerial navigation, to promote the intercourse of those interested in the subject at home
[Line 612] and abroad, and to give advice and instruction to those who study the principles upon which aeronautical science is based. From the date of
[Line 613] its foundation the Society has given special study to dynamic flight,
[Line 614] putting this before ballooning. Its library, its bureau of advice and
[Line 615] information, and its meetings, all assist in forwarding the study
[Line 616] of aeronautics, and its twenty-three early _Annual Reports_ are of considerable value, containing as they do a large amount of useful information on aeronautical subjects, and forming practically the basis of aeronautical science.  Ante to Wenham, Stringfellow and the French experimenters already
[Line 617] noted, by some years, was Le Bris, a French sea captain, who appears
[Line 618] to have required only a thorough scientific training to have rendered him of equal moment in the history of gliding flight with Lilienthal himself. Le Bris, it appears, watched the albatross and deduced, from
[Line 619] the manner in which it supported itself in the air, that plane surfaces
[Line 620] could be constructed and arranged to support a man in like manner. Octave Chanute, himself a leading exponent of gliding, gives the best description of Le Bris’s experiments in a work, _Progress in Flying Machines_, which, although published as recently as 1894, is already rare. Chanute draws from a still rarer book, namely, De la Landelle’s work published in 1884. Le Bris himself, quoted by De la Landelle as
[Line 621] speaking of his first visioning of human flight, describes how he killed an albatross, and then--‘I took the wing of the albatross and
[Line 622] exposed it to the breeze; and lo! in spite of me it drew forward into
[Line 623] the wind; notwithstanding my resistance it tended to rise. Thus I had
[Line 624] discovered the secret of the bird! I comprehended the whole mystery of flight.’ 
[Line 625] This apparently took place while at sea; later on Le Bris, returning to
[Line 626] France, designed and constructed an artificial albatross of sufficient size to bear his own weight. The fact that he followed the bird outline
[Line 627] as closely as he did attests his lack of scientific training for his
[Line 628] task, while at the same time the success of the experiment was proof
[Line 629] of his genius. The body of his artificial bird, boat-shaped, was 13½
[Line 630] ft. in length, with a breadth of 4 ft. at the widest part. The material was cloth stretched over a wooden framework; in front was a small mast rigged after the manner of a ship’s masts to which were attached poles
[Line 631] and cords with which Le Bris intended to work the wings. Each wing was 23 ft. in length, giving a total supporting surface of nearly 220
[Line 632] sq. ft.; the weight of the whole apparatus was only 92 pounds. For steering, both vertical and horizontal, a hinged tail was provided,
[Line 633] and the leading edge of each wing was made flexible. In construction
[Line 634] throughout, and especially in that of the wings, Le Bris adhered as
[Line 635] closely as possible to the original albatross. 
[Line 636] He designed an ingenious kind of mechanism which he termed ‘Rotules,’ which by means of two levers gave a rotary motion to the front edge of the wings, and also permitted of their adjustment to various angles. The inventor’s idea was to stand upright in the body of the
[Line 637] contrivance, working the levers and cords with his hands, and with his feet on a pedal by means of which the steering tail was to be worked. He anticipated that, given a strong wind, he could rise into the air
[Line 638] after the manner of an albatross, without any need for flapping his wings, and the account of his first experiment forms one of the most
[Line 639] interesting incidents in the history of flight. It is related in full in Chanute’s work, from which the present account is summarised.  Le Bris made his first experiment on a main road near Douarnenez, at Trefeuntec. From his observation of the albatross Le Bris concluded that it was necessary to get some initial velocity in order to make the
[Line 640] machine rise; consequently on a Sunday morning, with a breeze of about 12 miles an hour blowing down the road, he had his albatross placed on a cart and set off, with a peasant driver, against the wind. At the
[Line 641] outset the machine was fastened to the cart by a rope running through
[Line 642] the rails on which the machine rested, and secured by a slip knot on Le Bris’s own wrist, so that only a jerk on his part was necessary
[Line 643] to loosen the rope and set the machine free. On each side walked an
[Line 644] assistant holding the wings, and when a turn of the road brought the machine full into the wind these men were instructed to let go, while
[Line 645] the driver increased the pace from a walk to a trot. Le Bris, by pressure on the levers of the machine, raised the front edges of his
[Line 646] wings slightly; they took the wind almost instantly to such an extent that the horse, relieved of a great part of the weight he had been drawing, turned his trot into a gallop. Le Bris gave the jerk of the rope that should have unfastened the slip knot, but a concealed nail
[Line 647] on the cart caught the rope, so that it failed to run. The lift of the
[Line 648] machine was such, however, that it relieved the horse of very nearly the weight of the cart and driver, as well as that of Le Bris and his machine, and in the end the rails of the cart gave way. Le Bris rose in
[Line 649] the air, the machine maintaining perfect balance and rising to a height of nearly 300 ft., the total length of the glide being upwards of an
[Line 650] eighth of a mile. But at the last moment the rope which had originally fastened the machine to the cart got wound round the driver’s body, so
[Line 651] that this unfortunate dangled in the air under Le Bris and probably
[Line 652] assisted in maintaining the balance of the artificial albatross. Le
[Line 653] Bris, congratulating himself on his success, was prepared to enjoy just as long a time in the air as the pressure of the wind would permit, but the howls of the unfortunate driver at the end of the rope beneath him dispelled his dreams; by working his levers he altered the angle of
[Line 654] the front wing edges so skilfully as to make a very successful landing
[Line 655] indeed for the driver, who, entirely uninjured, disentangled himself
[Line 656] from the rope as soon as he touched the ground, and ran off to retrieve
[Line 657] his horse and cart.
[Line 658]  Apparently his release made a difference in the centre of gravity, for
[Line 659] Le Bris could not manipulate his levers for further ascent; by skilful
[Line 660] manipulation he retarded the descent sufficiently to escape injury to himself; the machine descended at an angle, so that one wing, striking the ground in front of the other, received a certain amount of damage.
[Line 661] It may have been on account of the reluctance of this same or another
[Line 662] driver that Le Bris chose a different method of launching himself in
[Line 663] making a second experiment with his albatross. He chose the edge of a
[Line 664] quarry which had been excavated in a depression of the ground; here
[Line 665] he assembled his apparatus at the bottom of the quarry, and by means
[Line 666] of a rope was hoisted to a height of nearly 100 ft. from the quarry
[Line 667] bottom, this rope being attached to a mast which he had erected upon the edge of the depression in which the quarry was situated. Thus
[Line 668] hoisted, the albatross was swung to face a strong breeze that blew inland, and Le Bris manipulated his levers to give the front edges of
[Line 669] his wings a downward angle, so that only the top surfaces should take
[Line 670] the wing pressure. Having got his balance, he obtained a lifting angle
[Line 671] of incidence on the wings by means of his levers, and released the hook that secured the machine, gliding off over the quarry. On the glide
[Line 672] he met with the inevitable upward current of air that the quarry and the depression in which it was situated caused; this current upset the balance of the machine and flung it to the bottom of the quarry, breaking it to fragments. Le Bris, apparently as intrepid as ingenious,
[Line 673] gripped the mast from which his levers were worked, and, springing
[Line 674] upward as the machine touched earth, escaped with no more damage than a broken leg. But for the rebound of the levers he would have escaped
[Line 675] even this. 
[Line 676] The interest of these experiments is enhanced by the fact that Le Bris was a seafaring man who conducted them from love of the science which had fired his imagination, and in so doing exhausted his own
[Line 677] small means. It was in 1855 that he made these initial attempts, and twelve years passed before his persistence was rewarded by a public subscription made at Brest for the purpose of enabling him to continue
[Line 678] his experiments. He built a second albatross, and on the advice of his friends ballasted it for flight instead of travelling in it himself.
[Line 679] It was not so successful as the first, probably owing to the lack of human control while in flight; on one of the trials a height of 150 ft. was attained, the glider being secured by a thin rope and held so as to face into the wind. A glide of nearly an eighth of a mile was made
[Line 680] with the rope hanging slack, and, at the end of this distance, a rise in the ground modified the force of the wind, whereupon the machine settled down without damage. A further trial in a gusty wind resulted
[Line 681] in the complete destruction of this second machine; Le Bris had no more funds, no further subscriptions were likely to materialise, and
[Line 682] so the experiments of this first exponent of the art of gliding (save for Besnier and his kind) came to an end. They constituted a notable
[Line 683] achievement, and undoubtedly Le Bris deserves a better place than has
[Line 684] been accorded him in the ranks of the early experimenters.
[Line 685] Contemporary with him was Charles Spencer, the first man to practise
[Line 686] gliding in England. His apparatus consisted of a pair of wings with
[Line 687] a total area of 30 sq. ft., to which a tail and body were attached.
[Line 688] The weight of this apparatus was some 24 lbs., and, launching himself
[Line 689] on it from a small eminence, as was done later by Lilienthal in his experiments, the inventor made flights of over 120 feet. The glider in
[Line 690] question was exhibited at the Aeronautical Exhibition of 1868.
[Line 691]   
[Line 692] VI  THE AGE OF THE GIANTS 
[Line 693] Until the Wright Brothers definitely solved the problem of flight and
[Line 694] virtually gave the aeroplane its present place in aeronautics, there
[Line 695] were three definite schools of experiment. The first of these was
[Line 696] that which sought to imitate nature by means of the ornithopter or
[Line 697] flapping-wing machines directly imitative of bird flight; the second school was that which believed in the helicopter or lifting screw; the third and eventually successful school is that which followed up the
[Line 698] principle enunciated by Cayley, that of opposing a plane surface to the resistance of the air by supplying suitable motive power to drive it at the requisite angle for support.  Engineering problems generally go to prove that too close an imitation of nature in her forms of reciprocating motion is not advantageous;
[Line 699] it is impossible to copy the minutiae of a bird’s wing effectively,
[Line 700] and the bird in flight depends on the tiniest details of its feathers just as much as on the general principle on which the whole wing is
[Line 701] constructed. Bird flight, however, has attracted many experimenters, including even Lilienthal; among others may be mentioned F. W. Brearey,
[Line 702] who invented what he called the ‘Pectoral cord,’ which stored energy on each upstroke of the artificial wing; E. P. Frost; Major R. Moore,
[Line 703] and especially Hureau de Villeneuve, a most enthusiastic student
[Line 704] of this form of flight, who began his experiments about 1865, and altogether designed and made nearly 300 artificial birds. One of his
[Line 705] later constructions was a machine in bird form with a wing span of
[Line 706] about 50 ft.; the motive power for this was supplied by steam from a
[Line 707] boiler which, being stationary on the ground, was connected by a length
[Line 708] of hose to the machine. De Villeneuve, turning on steam for his first trial, obtained sufficient power to make the wings beat very forcibly; with the inventor on the machine the latter rose several feet into the
[Line 709] air, whereupon de Villeneuve grew nervous and turned off the steam
[Line 710] supply. The machine fell to the earth, breaking one of its wings, and
[Line 711] it does not appear that de Villeneuve troubled to reconstruct it. This
[Line 712] experiment remains as the greatest success yet achieved by any machine
[Line 713] constructed on the ornithopter principle.
[Line 714] It may be that, as forecasted by the prophet Wells, the flapping-wing machine will yet come to its own and compete with the aeroplane in efficiency. Against this, however, are the practical advantages of the rotary mechanism of the aeroplane propeller as compared with the
[Line 715] movement of a bird’s wing, which, according to Marey, moves in a figure of eight. The force derived from a propeller is of necessity continual, while it is equally obvious that that derived from a flapping movement is intermittent, and, in the recovery of a wing after completion of one
[Line 716] stroke for the next, there is necessarily a certain cessation, if not loss, of power.  The matter of experiment along any lines in connection with aviation is primarily one of hard cash. Throughout the whole history of flight up to the outbreak of the European war development has been handicapped on the score of finance, and, since the arrival of the aeroplane, both ornithopter and helicopter schools have been handicapped by this consideration. Thus serious study of the efficiency of wings in imitation of those of the living bird has not been carried to a point
[Line 717] that might win success for this method of propulsion. Even Wilbur
[Line 718] Wright studied this subject and propounded certain theories, while a later and possibly more scientific student, F. W. Lanchester, has also contributed empirical conclusions. Another and earlier student
[Line 719] was Lawrence Hargrave, who made a wing-propelled model which achieved successful flight, and in 1885 was exhibited before the Royal Society
[Line 720] of New South Wales. Hargrave called the principle on which his
[Line 721] propeller worked that of a ‘Trochoided plane’; it was, in effect,
[Line 722] similar to the feathering of an oar.
[Line 723]  Hargrave, to diverge for a brief while from the machine to the man, was one who, although he achieved nothing worthy of special remark, contributed a great deal of painstaking work to the science of flight. He made a series of experiments with man-lifting kites in addition to
[Line 724] making a study of flapping-wing flight. It cannot be said that he set
[Line 725] forth any new principle; his work was mainly imitative, but at the same time by developing ideas originated in great measure by others he
[Line 726] helped toward the solution of the problem.
[Line 727]  Attempts at flight on the helicopter principle consist in the work of
[Line 728] De la Landelle and others already mentioned. The possibility of flight by this method is modified by a very definite disadvantage of which
[Line 729] lovers of the helicopter seem to take little account. It is always claimed for a machine of this type that it possesses great advantages
[Line 730] both in rising and in landing, since, if it were effective, it would obviously be able to rise from and alight on any ground capable of
[Line 731] containing its own bulk; a further advantage claimed is that the helicopter would be able to remain stationary in the air, maintaining
[Line 732] itself in any position by the vertical lift of its propeller. 
[Line 733] These potential assets do not take into consideration the fact that efficiency is required not only in rising, landing, and remaining
[Line 734] stationary in the air, but also in actual flight. It must be evident that if a certain amount of the motive force is used in maintaining the
[Line 735] machine off the ground, that amount of force is missing from the total of horizontal driving power. Again, it is often assumed by advocates
[Line 736] of this form of flight that the rapidity of climb of the helicopter
[Line 737] would be far greater than that of the driven plane; this view overlooks the fact that the maintenance of aerodynamic support would claim the greater part of the engine-power; the rate of ascent would be governed by the amount of power that could be developed surplus to that required for maintenance. 
[Line 738] This is best explained by actual figures: assuming that a propeller 15 ft. in diameter is used, almost 50 horse-power would be required to get an upward lift of 1,000 pounds; this amount of horse-power would be continually absorbed in maintaining the machine in the air at any given
[Line 739] level; for actual lift from one level to another at a speed of eleven feet per second a further 20 horse-power would be required, which means that 70 horse-power must be constantly provided for; this absorption
[Line 740] of power in the mere maintenance of aerodynamic support is a permanent drawback.  The attraction of the helicopter lies, probably, in the ease with
[Line 741] which flight is demonstrated by means of models constructed on this principle, but one truism with regard to the principles of flight
[Line 742] is that the problems change remarkably, and often unexpectedly, with the size of the machine constructed for experiment. Berriman, in a brief but very interesting manual entitled _Principles of Flight_, assumed that ‘there is a significant dimension of which the effective area is an expression of the second power, while the
[Line 743] weight became an expression of the third power. Then once again we have the two-thirds power law militating against the successful construction of large helicopters, on the ground that the essential weight increases disproportionately fast to the effective area. From a
[Line 744] consideration of the structural features of propellers it is evident that this particular relationship does not apply in practice, but it seems reasonable that some such governing factor should exist as an explanation of the apparent failure of all full-sized machines that
[Line 745] have been constructed. Among models there is nothing more strikingly
[Line 746] successful than the toy helicopter, in which the essential weight is so
[Line 747] small compared with the effective area.’
[Line 748] De la Landelle’s work, already mentioned, was carried on a few years later by another Frenchman, Castel, who constructed a machine with eight propellers arranged in two fours and driven by a compressed air motor or engine. The model with which Castel experimented had a
[Line 749] total weight of only 49 lbs.; it rose in the air and smashed itself
[Line 750] by driving against a wall, and the inventor does not seem to have proceeded further. Contemporary with Castel was Professor Forlanini, whose design was for a machine very similar to de la Landelle’s, with two superposed screws. This machine ranks as the second on the
[Line 751] helicopter principle to achieve flight; it remained in the air for no less than the third of a minute in one of its trials. 
[Line 752] Later experimenters in this direction were Kress, a German; Professor Wellner, an Austrian; and W. R. Kimball, an American. Kress, like most Germans, set to the development of an idea which others had originated;
[Line 753] he followed de la Landelle and Forlanini by fitting two superposed propellers revolving in opposite directions, and with this machine he
[Line 754] achieved good results as regards horse-power to weight; Kimball, it
[Line 755] appears, did not get beyond the rubber-driven model stage, and any success he may have achieved was modified by the theory enunciated by
[Line 756] Berriman and quoted above.
[Line 757]  Comparing these two schools of thought, the helicopter and bird-flight schools, it appears that the latter has the greater chance of eventual success--that is, if either should ever come into competition with the
[Line 758] aeroplane as effective means of flight. So far, the aeroplane holds the field, but the whole science of flight is so new and so full of
[Line 759] unexpected developments that this is no reason for assuming that other means may not give equal effect, when money and brains are diverted
[Line 760] from the driven plane to a closer imitation of natural flight. 
[Line 761] Reverting from non-success to success, from consideration of the two
[Line 762] methods mentioned above to the direction in which practical flight has been achieved, it is to be noted that between the time of Le Bris, Stringfellow, and their contemporaries, and the nineties of last century, there was much plodding work carried out with little visible result, more especially so far as English students were concerned. Among the incidents of those years is one of the most pathetic tragedies in the whole history of aviation, that of Alphonse Penaud, who, in his thirty years of life, condensed the experience of his predecessors and combined it with his own genius to state in a published patent what the aeroplane of to-day should be. Consider the following abstract of Penaud’s design as published in his patent of
[Line 763] 1876, and comparison of this with the aeroplane that now exists will show very few divergences except for those forced on the inventor by the fact that the internal combustion engine had not then developed.
[Line 764] The double-surfaced planes were to be built with wooden ribs and arranged with a slight dihedral angle; there was to be a large aspect ratio and the wings were cambered as in Stringfellow’s later models.
[Line 765] Provision was made for warping the wings while in flight, and the trailing edges were so designed as to be capable of upward twist while
[Line 766] the machine was in the air. The planes were to be placed above the car, and provision was even made for a glass wind-screen to give protection to the pilot during flight. Steering was to be accomplished by means of lateral and vertical planes forming a tail; these controlled by a
[Line 767] single lever corresponding to the ‘joy stick’ of the present day plane. 
[Line 768] Penaud conceived this machine as driven by two propellers; alternatively these could be driven by petrol or steam-fed motor,
[Line 769] and the centre of gravity of the machine while in flight was in the
[Line 770] front fifth of the wings. Penaud estimated from 20 to 30 horse-power
[Line 771] sufficient to drive this machine, weighing with pilot and passenger 2,600 lbs., through the air at a speed of 60 miles an hour, with the
[Line 772] wings set at an angle of incidence of two degrees. So complete was the
[Line 773] design that it even included instruments, consisting of an aneroid, pressure indicator, an anemometer, a compass, and a level. There,
[Line 774] with few alterations, is the aeroplane as we know it--and Penaud was
[Line 775] twenty-seven when his patent was published.  For three years longer he worked, experimenting with models, contributing essays and other valuable data to French papers on the
[Line 776] subject of aeronautics. His gains were ill health, poverty, and neglect, and at the age of thirty a pistol shot put an end to what had
[Line 777] promised to be one of the most brilliant careers in all the history of
[Line 778] flight.
[Line 779]  Two years before the publication of Penaud’s patent Thomas Moy
[Line 780] experimented at the Crystal Palace with a twin-propelled aeroplane,
[Line 781] steam driven, which seems to have failed mainly because the internal combustion engine had not yet come to give sufficient power for
[Line 782] weight. Moy anchored his machine to a pole running on a prepared
[Line 783] circular track; his engine weighed 80 lbs. and, developing only three
[Line 784] horse-power, gave him a speed of 12 miles an hour. He himself estimated that the machine would not rise until he could get a speed of 35 miles
[Line 785] an hour, and his estimate was correct. Two six-bladed propellers were
[Line 786] placed side by side between the two main planes of the machine, which
[Line 787] was supported on a triangular wheeled undercarriage and steered by fairly conventional tail planes. Moy realised that he could not get
[Line 788] sufficient power to achieve flight, but he went on experimenting in various directions, and left much data concerning his experiments which has not yet been deemed worthy of publication, but which still contains
[Line 789] a mass of information that is of practical utility, embodying as it does a vast amount of painstaking work. 
[Line 790] Penaud and Moy were followed by Goupil, a Frenchman, who, in place of
[Line 791] attempting to fit a motor to an aeroplane, experimented by making the wind his motor. He anchored his machine to the ground, allowing it two
[Line 792] feet of lift, and merely waited for a wind to come along and lift it. The machine was stream lined, and the wings, curving as in the early German patterns of war aeroplanes, gave a total lifting surface of
[Line 793] about 290 sq. ft. Anchored to the ground and facing a wind of 19 feet
[Line 794] per second, Goupil’s machine lifted its own weight and that of two men
[Line 795] as well to the limit of its anchorage. Although this took place as late as 1883 the inventor went no further in practical work. He published a book, however, entitled _La Locomotion Aérienne_, which is still of great importance, more especially on the subject of inherent stability.
[Line 796]  In 1884 came the first patents of Horatio Phillips, whose work lay
[Line 797] mainly in the direction of investigation into the curvature of plane surfaces, with a view to obtaining the greatest amount of support. Phillips was one of the first to treat the problem of curvature of planes as a matter for scientific experiment, and, great as has been
[Line 798] the development of the driven plane in the 36 years that have passed
[Line 799] since he began, there is still room for investigation into the subject which he studied so persistently and with such valuable result.
[Line 800] At this point it may be noted that, with the solitary exception of Le Bris, practically every student of flight had so far set about
[Line 801] constructing the means of launching humanity into the air without any
[Line 802] attempt at ascertaining the nature and peculiarities of the sustaining
[Line 803] medium. The attitude of experimenters in general might be compared to that of a man who from boyhood had grown up away from open water, and, at the first sight of an expanse of water, set to work to construct a
[Line 804] boat with a vague idea that, since wood would float, only sufficient power was required to make him an efficient navigator. Accident,
[Line 805] perhaps, in the shape of lack of means of procuring driving power,
[Line 806] drove Le Bris to the form of experiment which he actually carried out; it remained for the later years of the nineteenth century to produce men who were content to ascertain the nature of the support the air would afford before attempting to drive themselves through it.  Of the age in which these men lived and worked, giving their all in
[Line 807] many cases to the science they loved, even to life itself, it may be said with truth that ‘there were giants on the earth in those days,’ as
[Line 808] far as aeronautics is in question. It was an age of giants who lived
[Line 809] and dared and died, venturing into uncharted space, knowing nothing of its dangers, giving, as a man gives to his mistress, without stint
[Line 810] and for the joy of the giving. The science of to-day, compared with the glimmerings that were in that age of the giants, is a fixed and
[Line 811] certain thing; the problems of to-day are minor problems, for the great major problem vanished in solution when the Wright Brothers made their
[Line 812] first ascent. In that age of the giants was evolved the flying man,
[Line 813] the new type in human species which found full expression and came to
[Line 814] full development in the days of the war, achieving feats of daring and
[Line 815] endurance which leave the commonplace landsman staggered at thought of that of which his fellows prove themselves capable. He is a new type, this flying man, a being of self-forgetfulness; of such was Lilienthal,
[Line 816] of such was Pilcher; of such in later days were Farman, Bleriot, Hamel,
[Line 817] Rolls, and their fellows; great names that will live for as long as man flies, adventurers equally with those of the spacious days of
[Line 818] Elizabeth. To each of these came the call, and he worked and dared and
[Line 819] passed, having, perhaps, advanced one little step in the long march that has led toward the perfecting of flight.
[Line 820] It is not yet twenty years since man first flew, but into that twenty
[Line 821] years have been compressed a century or so of progress, while, in
[Line 822] the two decades that preceded it, was compressed still more. We have
[Line 823] only to recall and recount the work of four men: Lilienthal, Langley,
[Line 824] Pilcher, and Clement Ader to see the immense stride that was made between the time when Penaud pulled a trigger for the last time and
[Line 825] the Wright Brothers first left the earth. Into those two decades was compressed the investigation that meant knowledge of the qualities of
[Line 826] the air, together with the development of the one prime mover that
[Line 827] rendered flight a possibility--the internal combustion engine. The coming and progress of this latter is a thing apart, to be detailed separately; for the present we are concerned with the evolution of the driven plane, and with it the evolution of that daring being, the flying man. The two are inseparable, for the men gave themselves to their art; the story of Lilienthal’s life and death is the story of his
[Line 828] work; the story of Pilcher’s work is that of his life and death. 
[Line 829] Considering the flying man as he appeared in the war period, there entered into his composition a new element--patriotism--which brought
[Line 830] about a modification of the type, or, perhaps, made it appear that certain men belonged to the type who in reality were commonplace
[Line 831] mortals, animated, under normal conditions, by normal motives, but driven by the stress of the time to take rank with the last expression
[Line 832] of human energy, the flying type. However that may be, what may be termed the mathematising of aeronautics has rendered the type itself evanescent; your pilot of to-day knows his craft, once he is trained, much in the manner that a driver of a motor-lorry knows his vehicle;
[Line 833] design has been systematised, capabilities have been tabulated; camber, dihedral angle, aspect ratio, engine power, and plane surface, are
[Line 834] business items of drawing office and machine shop; there is room for enterprise, for genius, and for skill; once and again there is room for daring, as in the first Atlantic flight. Yet that again was a thing of
[Line 835] mathematical calculation and petrol storage, allied to a certain stark courage which may be found even in landsmen. For the ventures into the unknown, the limit of daring, the work for work’s sake, with the almost certainty that the final reward was death, we must look back to the age
[Line 836] of the giants, the age when flying was not a business, but romance.

[Line 841]  VII
[Line 842]  LILIENTHAL AND PILCHER
[Line 843]  There was never a more enthusiastic and consistent student of the
[Line 844] problems of flight than Otto Lilienthal, who was born in 1848 at Anklam, Pomerania, and even from his early school-days dreamed and planned the conquest of the air. His practical experiments began when,
[Line 845] at the age of thirteen, he and his brother Gustav made wings consisting of wooden framework covered with linen, which Otto attached to his arms, and then ran downhill flapping them. In consequence of possible
[Line 846] derision on the part of other boys, Otto confined these experiments for the most part to moonlit nights, and gained from them some idea
[Line 847] of the resistance offered by flat surfaces to the air. It was in 1867 that the two brothers began really practical work, experimenting with
[Line 848] wings which, from their design, indicate some knowledge of Besnier
[Line 849] and the history of his gliding experiments; these wings the brothers
[Line 850] fastened to their backs, moving them with their legs after the fashion of one attempting to swim. Before they had achieved any real success in
[Line 851] gliding the Franco-German war came as an interruption; both brothers
[Line 852] served in this campaign, resuming their experiments in 1871 at the conclusion of hostilities. 
[Line 853] The experiments made by the brothers previous to the war had convinced Otto that previous experimenters in gliding flight had failed
[Line 854] through reliance on empirical conclusions or else through incomplete observation on their own part, mostly of bird flight. From 1871 onward
[Line 855] Otto Lilienthal (Gustav’s interest in the problem was not maintained as was his brother’s) made what is probably the most detailed and accurate series of observations that has ever been made with regard to the
[Line 856] properties of curved wing surfaces. So far as could be done, Lilienthal
[Line 857] tabulated the amount of air resistance offered to a bird’s wing, ascertaining that the curve is necessary to flight, as offering far
[Line 858] more resistance than a flat surface. Cayley, and others, had already stated this, but to Lilienthal belongs the honour of being first to
[Line 859] put the statement to effective proof--he made over 2,000 gliding flights between 1891 and the regrettable end of his experiments; his
[Line 860] practical conclusions are still regarded as part of the accepted theory
[Line 861] of students of flight. In 1889 he published a work on the subject of
[Line 862] gliding flight which stands as data for investigators, and, on the
[Line 863] conclusions embodied in this work, he began to build his gliders and
[Line 864] practise what he had preached, turning from experiment with models to
[Line 865] wings that he could use.  It was in the summer of 1891 that he built his first glider of rods of peeled willow, over which was stretched strong cotton fabric; with this, which had a supporting surface of about 100 square feet, Otto Lilienthal launched himself in the air from a spring board, making glides which, at first of only a few feet, gradually lengthened. As
[Line 866] his experience of the supporting qualities of the air progressed he
[Line 867] gradually altered his designs until, when Pilcher visited him in the
[Line 868] spring of 1895, he experimented with a glider, roughly made of peeled willow rods and cotton fabric, having an area of 150 square feet and weighing half a hundredweight. By this time Lilienthal had moved from his springboard to a conical artificial hill which he had had thrown up on level ground at Grosse Lichterfelde, near Berlin. This hill was made
[Line 869] with earth taken from the excavations incurred in constructing a canal,
[Line 870] and had a cave inside in which Lilienthal stored his machines. Pilcher,
[Line 871] in his paper on ‘Gliding,’[1] gives an excellent short summary of Lilienthal’s experiments, from which the following extracts are taken:-- 
[Line 872] ‘At first Lilienthal used to experiment by jumping off a springboard with a good run. Then he took to practising on some hills close to
[Line 873] Berlin. In the summer of 1892 he built a flat-roofed hut on the summit
[Line 874] of a hill, from the top of which he used to jump, trying, of course,
[Line 875] to soar as far as possible before landing.... One of the great dangers
[Line 876] with a soaring machine is losing forward speed, inclining the machine
[Line 877] too much down in front, and coming down head first. Lilienthal was the first to introduce the system of handling a machine in the air merely by moving his weight about in the machine; he always rested only on his
[Line 878] elbows or on his elbows and shoulders.... 
[Line 879] ‘In 1892 a canal was being cut, close to where Lilienthal lived, in the
[Line 880] suburbs of Berlin, and with the surplus earth Lilienthal had a special hill thrown up to fly from. The country round is as flat as the sea,
[Line 881] and there is not a house or tree near it to make the wind unsteady, so
[Line 882] this was an ideal practising ground; for practising on natural hills is
[Line 883] generally rendered very difficult by shifty and gusty winds.... This
[Line 884] hill is 50 feet high, and conical. Inside the hill there is a cave for
[Line 885] the machines to be kept in.... When Lilienthal made a good flight he
[Line 886] used to land 300 feet from the centre of the hill, having come down at an angle of 1 in 6; but his best flights have been at an angle of about 1 in 10.  ‘If it is calm, one must run a few steps down the hill, holding the machine as far back on oneself as possible, when the air will gradually support one, and one slides off the hill into the air. If there is any wind, one should face it at starting; to try to start with a side wind is most unpleasant. It is possible after a great deal of practice to
[Line 887] turn in the air, and fairly quickly. This is accomplished by throwing one’s weight to one side, and thus lowering the machine on that side
[Line 888] towards which one wants to turn. Birds do the same thing--crows and gulls show it very clearly. Last year Lilienthal chiefly experimented
[Line 889] with double-surfaced machines. These were very much like the old machines with awnings spread above them.
[Line 890] ‘The object of making these double-surfaced machines was to get more
[Line 891] surface without increasing the length and width of the machine. This, of course, it does, but I personally object to any machine in which the wing surface is high above the weight. I consider that it makes the machine very difficult to handle in bad weather, as a puff of wind striking the surface, high above one, has a great tendency to heel the
[Line 892] machine over.  ‘Herr Lilienthal kindly allowed me to sail down his hill in one of these double-surfaced machines last June. With the great facility
[Line 893] afforded by his conical hill the machine was handy enough; but I am
[Line 894] afraid I should not be able to manage one at all in the squally
[Line 895] districts I have had to practise in over here. 
[Line 896] ‘Herr Lilienthal came to grief through deserting his old method of balancing. In order to control his tipping movements more rapidly he
[Line 897] attached a line from his horizontal rudder to his head, so that when he
[Line 898] moved his head forward it would lift the rudder and tip the machine up
[Line 899] in front, and vice versa. He was practising this on some natural hills
[Line 900] outside Berlin, and he apparently got muddled with the two motions,
[Line 901] and, in trying to regain speed after he had, through a lull in the wind, come to rest in the air, let the machine get too far down in
[Line 902] front, came down head first and was killed.’
[Line 903]  Then in another passage Pilcher enunciates what is the true value of
[Line 904] such experiments as Lilienthal--and, subsequently, he himself--made:
[Line 905] ‘The object of experimenting with soaring machines,’ he says, ‘is to
[Line 906] enable one to have practice in starting and alighting and controlling
[Line 907] a machine in the air. They cannot possibly float horizontally in the air for any length of time, but to keep going must necessarily lose in
[Line 908] elevation. They are excellent schooling machines, and that is all they
[Line 909] are meant to be, until power, in the shape of an engine working a screw
[Line 910] propeller, or an engine working wings to drive the machine forward, is
[Line 911] added; then a person who is used to soaring down a hill with a simple soaring machine will be able to fly with comparative safety. One can
[Line 912] best compare them to bicycles having no cranks, but on which one could
[Line 913] learn to balance by coming down an incline.’  It was in 1895 that Lilienthal passed from experiment with the
[Line 914] monoplane type of glider to the construction of a biplane glider which, according to his own account, gave better results than his previous machines. ‘Six or seven metres velocity of wind,’ he says,
[Line 915] ‘sufficed to enable the sailing surface of 18 square metres to carry me
[Line 916] almost horizontally against the wind from the top of my hill without any starting jump. If the wind is stronger I allow myself to be simply lifted from the point of the hill and to sail slowly towards the wind.
[Line 917] The direction of the flight has, with strong wind, a strong upwards
[Line 918] tendency. I often reach positions in the air which are much higher than
[Line 919] my starting point. At the climax of such a line of flight I sometimes
[Line 920] come to a standstill for some time, so that I am enabled while floating
[Line 921] to speak with the gentlemen who wish to photograph me, regarding the
[Line 922] best position for the photographing.’ 
[Line 923] Lilienthal’s work did not end with simple gliding, though he did not live to achieve machine-driven flight. Having, as he considered, gained sufficient experience with gliders, he constructed a power-driven
[Line 924] machine which weighed altogether about 90 lbs., and this was thoroughly tested. The extremities of its wings were made to flap, and the driving
[Line 925] power was obtained from a cylinder of compressed carbonic acid gas, released through a hand-operated valve which, Lilienthal anticipated, would keep the machine in the air for four minutes. There were certain minor accidents to the mechanism, which delayed the trial flights,
[Line 926] and on the day that Lilienthal had determined to make his trial he made a long gliding flight with a view to testing a new form of rudder
[Line 927] that--as Pilcher relates--was worked by movements of his head. His death came about through the causes that Pilcher states; he fell from a height of 50 feet, breaking his spine, and the next day he died.
[Line 928]  It may be said that Lilienthal accomplished as much as any one of the great pioneers of flying. As brilliant in his conceptions as da Vinci
[Line 929] had been in his, and as conscientious a worker as Borelli, he laid the
[Line 930] foundations on which Pilcher, Chanute, and Professor Montgomery were
[Line 931] able to build to such good purpose. His book on bird flight, published
[Line 932] in 1889, with the authorship credited both to Otto and his brother Gustav, is regarded as epoch-making; his gliding experiments are no less entitled to this description.
[Line 933]  In England Lilienthal’s work was carried on by Percy Sinclair Pilcher, who, born in 1866, completed six years’ service in the British Navy
[Line 934] by the time that he was nineteen, and then went through a course of
[Line 935] engineering, subsequently joining Maxim in his experimental work. It was not until 1895 that he began to build the first of the series of gliders with which he earned his plane among the pioneers of flight. Probably the best account of Pilcher’s work is that given in the
[Line 936] _Aeronautical Classics_ issued by the Royal Aeronautical Society, from which the following account of Pilcher’s work is mainly abstracted.[2]
[Line 937] The ‘Bat,’ as Pilcher named his first glider, was a monoplane which he
[Line 938] completed before he paid his visit to Lilienthal in 1895. Concerning
[Line 939] this Pilcher stated that he purposely finished his own machine before
[Line 940] going to see Lilienthal, so as to get the greatest advantage from any
[Line 941] original ideas he might have; he was not able to make any trials with
[Line 942] this machine, however, until after witnessing Lilienthal’s experiments and making several glides in the biplane glider which Lilienthal constructed.
[Line 943]  The wings of the ‘Bat’ formed a pronounced dihedral angle; the tips being raised 4 feet above the body. The spars forming the entering
[Line 944] edges of the wings crossed each other in the centre and were lashed to
[Line 945] opposite sides of the triangle that served as a mast for the stay-wires
[Line 946] that guyed the wings. The four ribs of each wing, enclosed in pockets in the fabric, radiated fanwise from the centre, and were each stayed
[Line 947] by three steel piano-wires to the top of the triangular mast, and
[Line 948] similarly to its base. These ribs were bolted down to the triangle at their roots, and could be easily folded back on to the body when the
[Line 949] glider was not in use. A small fixed vertical surface was carried in the rear. The framework and ribs were made entirely of Riga pine; the surface fabric was nainsook. The area of the machine was 150 square
[Line 950] feet; its weight 45 lbs.; so that in flight, with Pilcher’s weight of 145 lbs. added, it carried one and a half pounds to the square foot.
[Line 951]  [Illustration: Rear view of Pilcher’s ‘Beetle.’]
[Line 952]  [Illustration: The ‘Beetle.’ side view.]  [Illustration: Pilcher starting on glide with the ‘Bat.’]
[Line 953]  Pilcher’s first glides, which he carried out on a grass hill on
[Line 954] the banks of the Clyde near Cardross, gave little result, owing to the exaggerated dihedral angle of the wings, and the absence of a
[Line 955] horizontal tail. The ‘Bat’ was consequently reconstructed with a
[Line 956] horizontal tail-plane added to the vertical one, and with the wings lowered so that the tips were only six inches above the level of the
[Line 957] body. The machine now gave far better results; on the first glide into
[Line 958] a head wind Pilcher rose to a height of twelve feet and remained in
[Line 959] the air for a third of a minute; in the second attempt a rope was used
[Line 960] to tow the glider, which rose to twenty feet and did not come to earth again until nearly a minute had passed. With experience Pilcher was
[Line 961] able to lengthen his glide and improve his balance, but the dropped
[Line 962] wing tips made landing difficult, and there were many breakages.
[Line 963] In consequence of this Pilcher built a second glider which he named
[Line 964] the ‘Beetle,’ because, as he said, it looked like one. In this the
[Line 965] square-cut wings formed almost a continuous plane, rigidly fixed to the central body, which consisted of a shaped girder. These wings were
[Line 966] built up of five transverse bamboo spars, with two shaped ribs running from fore to aft of each wing, and were stayed overhead to a couple
[Line 967] of masts. The tail, consisting of two discs placed crosswise (the horizontal one alone being movable), was carried high up in the rear.
[Line 968] With the exception of the wing-spars, the whole framework was built of white pine. The wings in this machine were actually on a higher level than the operator’s head; the centre of gravity was, consequently, very
[Line 969] low, a fact which, according to Pilcher’s own account, made the glider
[Line 970] very difficult to handle. Moreover, the weight of the ‘Beetle,’ 80
[Line 971] lbs., was considerable; the body had been very solidly built to enable it to carry the engine which Pilcher was then contemplating; so that
[Line 972] the glider carried some 225 lbs. with its area of 170 square feet-too great a mass for a single man to handle with comfort.
[Line 973] It was in the spring of 1896 that Pilcher built his third glider,
[Line 974] the ‘Gull,’ with 300 square feet of area and a weight of 55 lbs. The size of this machine rendered it unsuitable for experiment in any but
[Line 975] very calm weather, and it incurred such damage when experiments were made in a breeze that Pilcher found it necessary to build a fourth, which he named the ‘Hawk.’ This machine was very soundly built, being
[Line 976] constructed of bamboo, with the exception of the two main transverse
[Line 977] beams. The wings were attached to two vertical masts, 7 feet high, and
[Line 978] 8 feet apart, joined at their summits and their centres by two wooden beams. Each wing had nine bamboo ribs, radiating from its mast, which
[Line 979] was situated at a distance of 2 feet 6 inches from the forward edge of the wing. Each rib was rigidly stayed at the top of the mast by three tie-wires, and by a similar number to the bottom of the mast, by which means the curve of each wing was maintained uniformly. The tail
[Line 980] was formed of a triangular horizontal surface to which was affixed a
[Line 981] triangular vertical surface, and was carried from the body on a high bamboo mast, which was also stayed from the masts by means of steel wires, but only on its upper surface, and it was the snapping of one of these guy wires which caused the collapse of the tail support and brought about the fatal end of Pilcher s experiments. In flight,
[Line 982] Pilcher’s head, shoulders, and the greater part of his chest projected
[Line 983] above the wings. He took up his position by passing his head and
[Line 984] shoulders through the top aperture formed between the two wings, and
[Line 985] resting his forearms on the longitudinal body members. A very simple
[Line 986] form of undercarriage, which took the weight off the glider on the ground, was fitted, consisting of two bamboo rods with wheels suspended
[Line 987] on steel springs.  Balance and steering were effected, apart from the high degree of
[Line 988] inherent stability afforded by the tail, as in the case of Lilienthal’s glider, by altering the position of the body. With this machine Pilcher
[Line 989] made some twelve glides at Eynsford in Kent in the summer of 1896,
[Line 990] and as he progressed he increased the length of his glides, and also
[Line 991] handled the machine more easily, both in the air and in landing. He was
[Line 992] occupied with plans for fitting an engine and propeller to the ‘Hawk,’ but, in these early days of the internal combustion engine, was unable
[Line 993] to get one light enough for his purpose. There were rumours of an engine weighing 15 lbs. which gave 1 horse-power, and was reported to
[Line 994] be in existence in America, but it could not be traced.
[Line 995] In the spring of 1897 Pilcher took up his gliding experiments again, obtaining what was probably the best of his glides on June 19th, when
[Line 996] he alighted after a perfectly balanced glide of over 250 yards in
[Line 997] length, having crossed a valley at a considerable height. From his
[Line 998] various experiments he concluded that once the machine was launched
[Line 999] in the air an engine of, at most, 3 horse-power would suffice for
[Line 1000] the maintenance of horizontal flight, but he had to allow for the additional weight of the engine and propeller, and taking into account the comparative inefficiency of the propeller, he planned for an engine of 4 horse-power. Engine and propeller together were estimated at under 44 lbs. weight, the engine was to be fitted in front of the operator,
[Line 1001] and by means of an overhead shaft was to operate the propeller
[Line 1002] situated in rear of the wings. 1898 went by while this engine was
[Line 1003] under construction. Then in 1899 Pilcher became interested in Lawrence
[Line 1004] Hargrave’s soaring kites, with which he carried out experiments during
[Line 1005] the summer of 1899. It is believed that he intended to incorporate a number of these kites in a new machine, a triplane, of which the
[Line 1006] fragments remaining are hardly sufficient to reconstitute the complete glider. This new machine was never given a trial, for on September 30th, 1899, at Stamford Hall, Market Harborough, Pilcher agreed to
[Line 1007] give a demonstration of gliding flight, but owing to the unfavourable
[Line 1008] weather he decided to postpone the trial of the new machine and to
[Line 1009] experiment with the ‘Hawk,’ which was intended to rise from a level field, towed by a line passing over a tackle drawn by two horses. At the first trial the machine rose easily, but the tow-line snapped when
[Line 1010] it was well clear of the ground, and the glider descended, weighed down
[Line 1011] through being sodden with rain. Pilcher resolved on a second trial, in
[Line 1012] which the glider again rose easily to about thirty feet, when one of
[Line 1013] the guy wires of the tail broke, and the tail collapsed; the machine fell to the ground, turning over, and Pilcher was unconscious when he was freed from the wreckage. 
[Line 1014] Hopes were entertained of his recovery, but he died on Monday, October
[Line 1015] 2nd, 1899, aged only thirty-four. His work in the cause of flying lasted only four years, but in that time his actual accomplishments were sufficient to place his name beside that of Lilienthal, with whom he ranks as one of the greatest exponents of gliding flight.

[Line 1020]  AMERICAN GLIDING EXPERIMENTS 
[Line 1021] While Pilcher was carrying on Lilienthal’s work in England, the great
[Line 1022] German had also a follower in America; one Octave Chanute, who, in one of the statements which he has left on the subject of his experiments acknowledges forty years’ interest in the problem of flight, did more
[Line 1023] to develop the glider in America than--with the possible exception
[Line 1024] of Montgomery--any other man. Chanute had all the practicality of an
[Line 1025] American; he began his work, so far as actual gliding was concerned, with a full-sized glider of the Lilienthal type, just before Lilienthal was killed. In a rather rare monograph, entitled _Experiments in
[Line 1026] Flying_, Chanute states that he found the Lilienthal glider hazardous and decided to test the value of an idea of his own; in this he followed the same general method, but reversed the principle upon which Lilienthal had depended for maintaining his equilibrium in the
[Line 1027] air. Lilienthal had shifted the weight of his body, under immovable
[Line 1028] wings, as fast and as far as the sustaining pressure varied under his surfaces; this shifting was mainly done by moving the feet, as the
[Line 1029] actions required were small except when alighting. Chanute’s idea was
[Line 1030] to have the operator remain seated in the machine in the air, and to intervene only to steer or to alight; moving mechanism was provided
[Line 1031] to adjust the wings automatically, in order to restore balance when
[Line 1032] necessary.
[Line 1033]  Chanute realised that experiments with models were of little use; in
[Line 1034] order to be fully instructive, these experiments should be made with a full-sized machine which carried its operator, for models seldom fly twice alike in the open air, and no relation can be gained from them
[Line 1035] of the divergent air currents which they have experienced. Chanute’s
[Line 1036] idea was that any flying machine which might be constructed must
[Line 1037] be able to operate in a wind; hence the necessity for an operator
[Line 1038] to report upon what occurred in flight, and to acquire practical experience of the work of the human factor in imitation of bird
[Line 1039] flight. From this point of view he conducted his own experiments;
[Line 1040] it must be noted that he was over sixty years of age when he began,
[Line 1041] and, being no longer sufficiently young and active to perform any but
[Line 1042] short and insignificant glides, the courage of the man becomes all the
[Line 1043] more noteworthy; he set to work to evolve the state required by the
[Line 1044] problem of stability, and without any expectation of advancing to the
[Line 1045] construction of a flying machine which might be of commercial value.
[Line 1046] His main idea was the testing of devices to secure equilibrium; for this purpose he employed assistants to carry out the practical work,
[Line 1047] where he himself was unable to supply the necessary physical energy.
[Line 1048]  Together with his assistants he found a suitable place for experiments
[Line 1049] among the sandhills on the shore of Lake Michigan, about thirty miles eastward from Chicago. Here a hill about ninety-five feet high was
[Line 1050] selected as a point from which Chanute’s gliders could set off; in
[Line 1051] practice, it was found that the best observation was to be obtained from short glides at low speed, and, consequently, a hill which was only sixty-one feet above the shore of the lake was employed for the experimental work done by the party.  In the years 1896 and 1897, with parties of from four to six persons, five full-sized gliders were tried out, and from these two distinct types were evolved: of these one was a machine consisting of five tiers of wings and a steering tail, and the other was of the biplane type;
[Line 1052] Chanute believed these to be safer than any other machine previously
[Line 1053] evolved, solving, as he states in his monograph, the problem of
[Line 1054] inherent equilibrium as fully as this could be done. Unfortunately, very few photographs were taken of the work in the first year, but one
[Line 1055] view of a multiple wing-glider survives, showing the machine in flight.
[Line 1056] In 1897 a series of photographs was taken exhibiting the consecutive
[Line 1057] phases of a single flight; this series of photographs represents the
[Line 1058] experience gained in a total of about one thousand glides, but the point of view was varied so as to exhibit the consecutive phases of one
[Line 1059] single flight.  The experience gained is best told in Chanute’s own words. ‘The first thing,’ he says, ‘which we discovered practically was that the wind
[Line 1060] flowing up a hill-side is not a steadily-flowing current like that
[Line 1061] of a river. It comes as a rolling mass, full of tumultuous whirls
[Line 1062] and eddies, like those issuing from a chimney; and they strike the apparatus with constantly varying force and direction, sometimes
[Line 1063] withdrawing support when most needed. It has long been known, through
[Line 1064] instrumental observations, that the wind is constantly changing in force and direction; but it needed the experience of an operator afloat
[Line 1065] on a gliding machine to realise that this all proceeded from cyclonic action; so that more was learned in this respect in a week than had previously been acquired by several years of experiments with models. There was a pair of eagles, living in the top of a dead tree about two miles from our tent, that came almost daily to show us how such wind
[Line 1066] effects are overcome and utilised. The birds swept in circles overhead on pulseless wings, and rose high up in the air. Occasionally there was a side-rocking motion, as of a ship rolling at sea, and then the birds rocked back to an even keel; but although we thought the action
[Line 1067] was clearly automatic, and were willing to learn, our teachers were too far off to show us just how it was done, and we had to experiment for ourselves.’ 
[Line 1068] Chanute provided his multiple glider with a seat, but, since each glide only occupied between eight and twelve seconds, there was
[Line 1069] little possibility of the operator seating himself. With the multiple
[Line 1070] glider a pair of horizontal bars provided rest for the arms, and
[Line 1071] beyond these was a pair of vertical bars which the operator grasped with his hands; beyond this, the operator was in no way attached to
[Line 1072] the machine. He took, at the most, four running steps into the wind, which launched him in the air, and thereupon he sailed into the wind
[Line 1073] on a generally descending course. In the matter of descent Chanute
[Line 1074] observed the sparrow and decided to imitate it. ‘When the latter,’ he says, ‘approaches the street, he throws his body back, tilts his outspread wings nearly square to the course, and on the cushion of air
[Line 1075] thus encountered he stops his speed and drops lightly to the ground.
[Line 1076] So do all birds. We tried it with misgivings, but found it perfectly effective. The soft sand was a great advantage, and even when the experts were racing there was not a single sprained ankle.’
[Line 1077] With the multiple winged glider some two to three hundred glides were
[Line 1078] made without any accident either to the man or to the machine, and the
[Line 1079] action was found so effective, the principle so sound, that full plans
[Line 1080] were published for the benefit of any experimenters who might wish to improve on this apparatus. The American _Aeronautical Annual_ for 1897 contains these plans; Chanute confessed that some movement on the part of the operator was still required to control the machine, but it was
[Line 1081] only a seventh or a sixth part of the movement required for control of
[Line 1082] the Lilienthal type.
[Line 1083]  Chanute waxed enthusiastic over the possibilities of gliding, concerning which he remarks that ‘There is no more delightful sensation
[Line 1084] than that of gliding through the air. All the faculties are on the alert, and the motion is astonishingly smooth and elastic. The machine responds instantly to the slightest movement of the operator; the air
[Line 1085] rushes by one’s ears; the trees and bushes flit away underneath, and
[Line 1086] the landing comes all too quickly. Skating, sliding, and bicycling
[Line 1087] are not to be compared for a moment to aerial conveyance, in which, perhaps, zest is added by the spice of danger. For it must be
[Line 1088] distinctly understood that there is constant danger in such preliminary experiments. When this hazard has been eliminated by further evolution,
[Line 1089] gliding will become a most popular sport.’
[Line 1090] Later experiments proved that the biplane type of glider gave better results than the rather cumbrous model consisting of five tiers of planes. Longer and more numerous glides, to the number of seven to eight hundred, were obtained, the rate of descent being about one in six. The longest distance traversed was about 120 yards, but Chanute
[Line 1091] had dreams of starting from a hill about 200 feet high, which would
[Line 1092] have given him gliding flights of 1,200 feet. He remarked that ‘In consequence of the speed gained by running, the initial stage of the flight is nearly horizontal, and it is thrilling to see the operator pass from thirty to forty feet overhead, steering his machine, undulating his course, and struggling with the wind-gusts which whistle through the guy wires. The automatic mechanism restores the angle of advance when compromised by variations of the breeze; but when these
[Line 1093] come from one side and tilt the apparatus, the weight has to be shifted to right the machine ... these gusts sometimes raise the machine from ten to twenty feet vertically, and sometimes they strike the apparatus from above, causing it to descend suddenly. When sailing near the ground, these vicissitudes can be counteracted by movements of the body from three to four inches; but this has to be done instantly, for neither wings nor gravity will wait on meditation. At a height of three hundred or four hundred feet the regulating mechanism would probably take care of these wind-gusts, as it does, in fact, for their
[Line 1094] minor variations. The speed of the machine is generally about seventeen miles an hour over the ground, and from twenty-two to thirty miles an hour relative to the air. Constant effort was directed to keep down the velocity, which was at times fifty-two miles an hour. This is the purpose of the starting and gliding against the wind, which thus
[Line 1095] furnishes an initial velocity without there being undue speed at the landing. The highest wind we dared to experiment in blew at thirty-one miles an hour; when the wind was stronger, we waited and watched the birds.’
[Line 1096]  Chanute details an amusing little incident which occurred in the course
[Line 1097] of experiment with the biplane glider. He says that ‘We had taken one of the machines to the top of the hill, and loaded its lower wings with sand to hold it while we went to lunch. A gull came strolling
[Line 1098] inland, and flapped full-winged to inspect. He swept several circles
[Line 1099] above the machine, stretched his neck, gave a squawk and went off.
[Line 1100] Presently he returned with eleven other gulls, and they seemed to hold
[Line 1101] a conclave about one hundred feet above the big new white bird which they had discovered on the sand. They circled round after round, and
[Line 1102] once in a while there was a series of loud peeps, like those of a rusty
[Line 1103] gate, as if in conference, with sudden flutterings, as if a terrifying suggestion had been made. The bolder birds occasionally swooped downwards to inspect the monster more closely; they twisted their heads around to bring first one eye and then the other to bear, and then they
[Line 1104] rose again. After some seven or eight minutes of this performance, they evidently concluded either that the stranger was too formidable
[Line 1105] to tackle, if alive, or that he was not good to eat, if dead, and they flew off to resume fishing, for the weak point about a bird is his
[Line 1106] stomach.’
[Line 1107] The gliders were found so stable, more especially the biplane form,
[Line 1108] that in the end Chanute permitted amateurs to make trials under
[Line 1109] guidance, and throughout the whole series of experiments not a single
[Line 1110] accident occurred. Chanute came to the conclusion that any young, quick, and handy man could master a gliding machine almost as soon
[Line 1111] as he could get the hang of a bicycle, although the penalty for any
[Line 1112] mistake would be much more severe.
[Line 1113] At the conclusion of his experiments he decided that neither the multiple plane nor the biplane type of glider was sufficiently
[Line 1114] perfected for the application of motive power. In spite of the amount
[Line 1115] of automatic stability that he had obtained he considered that there
[Line 1116] was yet more to be done, and he therefore advised that every possible method of securing stability and safety should be tested, first with
[Line 1117] models, and then with full-sized machines; designers, he said, should make a point of practice in order to make sure of the action, to
[Line 1118] proportion and adjust the parts of their machine, and to eliminate
[Line 1119] hidden defects. Experimental flight, he suggested, should be tried over water, in order to break any accidental fall; when a series of
[Line 1120] experiments had proved the stability of a glider, it would then be time to apply motive power. He admitted that such a process would be both costly and slow, but, he said, that ‘it greatly diminished the chance
[Line 1121] of those accidents which bring a whole line of investigation into
[Line 1122] contempt.’ He saw the flying machine as what it has, in fact, been; a
[Line 1123] child of evolution, carried on step by step by one investigator after
[Line 1124] another, through the stages of doubt and perplexity which lie behind
[Line 1125] the realm of possibility, beyond which is the present day stage of
[Line 1126] actual performance and promise of ultimate success and triumph over the earlier, more cumbrous, and slower forms of the transport that we know.  [Illustration: Chanute biplane glider.]  Chanute’s monograph, from which the foregoing notes have been
[Line 1127] comprised, was written soon after the conclusion of his series of experiments. He does not appear to have gone in for further practical
[Line 1128] work, but to have studied the subject from a theoretical view-point and with great attention to the work done by others. In a paper
[Line 1129] contributed in 1900 to the American _Independent_, he remarks that
[Line 1130] ‘Flying machines promise better results as to speed, but yet will be of limited commercial application. They may carry mails and reach other
[Line 1131] inaccessible places, but they cannot compete with railroads as carriers
[Line 1132] of passengers or freight. They will not fill the heavens with commerce,
[Line 1133] abolish custom houses, or revolutionise the world, for they will be
[Line 1134] expensive for the loads which they can carry, and subject to too many weather contingencies. Success is, however, probable. Each experimenter
[Line 1135] has added something to previous knowledge which his successors can avail of. It now seems likely that two forms of flying machines, a
[Line 1136] sporting type and an exploration type, will be gradually evolved within
[Line 1137] one or two generations, but the evolution will be costly and slow, and
[Line 1138] must be carried on by well-equipped and thoroughly informed scientific men; for the casual inventor, who relies upon one or two happy
[Line 1139] inspirations, will have no chance of success whatever.’
[Line 1140]  Follows Professor John J. Montgomery, who, in the true American spirit,
[Line 1141] describes his own experiments so well that nobody can possibly do it better. His account of his work was given first of all in the American
[Line 1142] Journal, _Aeronautics_, in January, 1909, and thence transcribed in the English paper of the same name in May, 1910, and that account is here copied word for word. It may, however, be noted first that as far back as 1860, when Montgomery was only a boy, he was attracted to
[Line 1143] the study of aeronautical problems, and in 1883 he built his first
[Line 1144] machine, which was of the flapping-wing ornithopter type, and which showed its designer, with only one experiment, that he must design some
[Line 1145] other form of machine if he wished to attain to a successful flight. Chanute details how, in 1884 and 1885, Montgomery built three gliders, demonstrating the value of curved surfaces. With the first of these
[Line 1146] gliders Montgomery copied the wing of a seagull; with the second he
[Line 1147] proved that a flat surface was virtually useless, and with the third he pivoted his wings as in the Antoinette type of power-propelled
[Line 1148] aeroplane, proving to his own satisfaction that success lay in this direction. His own account of the gliding flights carried out under his
[Line 1149] direction is here set forth, being the best description of his work
[Line 1150] that can be obtained:--  ‘When I commenced practical demonstration in my work with aeroplanes
[Line 1151] I had before me three points; first, equilibrium; second, complete
[Line 1152] control; and third, long continued or soaring flight. In starting I
[Line 1153] constructed and tested three sets of models, each in advance of the
[Line 1154] other in regard to the continuance of their soaring powers, but all
[Line 1155] equally perfect as to equilibrium and control. These models were tested
[Line 1156] by dropping them from a cable stretched between two mountain tops, with
[Line 1157] various loads, adjustments and positions. And it made no difference whether the models were dropped upside down or any other conceivable position, they always found their equilibrium immediately and glided
[Line 1158] safely to earth.
[Line 1159]  ‘Then I constructed a large machine patterned after the first model,
[Line 1160] and with the assistance of three cowboy friends personally made a
[Line 1161] number of flights in the steep mountains near San Juan (a hundred miles distant). In making these flights I simply took the aeroplane
[Line 1162] and made a running jump. These tests were discontinued after I put my
[Line 1163] foot into a squirrel hole in landing and hurt my leg.  The following year I commenced the work on a larger scale, by engaging aeronauts to ride my aeroplane dropped from balloons. During this
[Line 1164] work I used five hot-air balloons and one gas balloon, five or six
[Line 1165] aeroplanes, three riders--Maloney, Wilkie, and Defolco--and had sixteen
[Line 1166] applicants on my list, and had a training station to prepare any when I
[Line 1167] needed them.  ‘Exhibitions were given in Santa Cruz, San Jose, Santa Clara, Oakland,
[Line 1168] and Sacramento. The flights that were made, instead of being haphazard affairs, were in the order of safety and development. In the first
[Line 1169] flight of an aeronaut the aeroplane was so arranged that the rider had
[Line 1170] little liberty of action, consequently he could make only a limited flight. In some of the first flights, the aeroplane did little more than settle in the air. But as the rider gained experience in each successive flight I changed the adjustments, giving him more liberty of action, so he could obtain longer flights and more varied movements in
[Line 1171] the flights. But in none of the flights did I have the adjustments so that the riders had full liberty, as I did not consider that they had the requisite knowledge and experience necessary for their safety; and
[Line 1172] hence, none of my aeroplanes were launched so arranged that the rider could make adjustments necessary for a full flight.
[Line 1173]  ‘This line of action caused a good deal of trouble with aeronauts or
[Line 1174] riders, who had unbounded confidence and wanted to make long flights after the first few trials; but I found it necessary, as they seemed slow in comprehending the important elements and were willing to take risks. To give them the full knowledge in these matters I was formulating plans for a large starting station on the Mount Hamilton
[Line 1175] Range from which I could launch an aeroplane capable of carrying two,
[Line 1176] one of my aeronauts and myself, so I could teach him by demonstration.
[Line 1177] But the disasters consequent on the great earthquake completely stopped all my work on these lines. The flights that were given were only the first of the series with aeroplanes patterned after the first model. There were no aeroplanes constructed according to the two other models, as I had not given the full demonstration of the workings of the first,
[Line 1178] though some remarkable and startling work was done. On one occasion Maloney, in trying to make a very short turn in rapid flight, pressed
[Line 1179] very hard on the stirrup which gives a screw-shape to the wings, and made a side somersault. The course of the machine was very much like one turn of a corkscrew. After this movement the machine continued on its regular course. And afterwards Wilkie, not to be outdone by
[Line 1180] Maloney, told his friends he would do the same, and in a subsequent
[Line 1181] flight made two side somersaults, one in one direction and the other in an opposite, then made a deep dive and a long glide, and, when about three hundred feet in the air, brought the aeroplane to a sudden stop and settled to the earth. After these antics, I decreased the extent of the possible change in the form of wing-surface, so as to allow only straight sailing or only long curves in turning. 
[Line 1182] ‘During my work I had a few carping critics that I silenced by this
[Line 1183] standing offer: If they would deposit a thousand dollars I would cover
[Line 1184] it on this proposition. I would fasten a 150 pound sack of sand in the rider’s seat, make the necessary adjustments, and send up an aeroplane
[Line 1185] upside down with a balloon, the aeroplane to be liberated by a time fuse. If the aeroplane did not immediately right itself, make a flight,
[Line 1186] and come safely to the ground, the money was theirs.  ‘Now a word in regard to the fatal accident. The circumstances are
[Line 1187] these: The ascension was given to entertain a military company in which were many of Maloney’s friends, and he had told them he would give the
[Line 1188] most sensational flight they ever heard of. As the balloon was rising with the aeroplane, a guy rope dropping switched around the right wing and broke the tower that braced the two rear wings and which also gave
[Line 1189] control over the tail. We shouted Maloney that the machine was broken,
[Line 1190] but he probably did not hear us, as he was at the same time saying,
[Line 1191] “Hurrah for Montgomery’s airship,” and as the break was behind him,
[Line 1192] he may not have detected it. Now did he know of the breakage or not, and if he knew of it did he take a risk so as not to disappoint his
[Line 1193] friends? At all events, when the machine started on its flight the rear wings commenced to flap (thus indicating they were loose), the machine
[Line 1194] turned on its back, and settled a little faster than a parachute. When we reached Maloney he was unconscious and lived only thirty minutes.
[Line 1195] The only mark of any kind on him was a scratch from a wire on the side of his neck. The six attending physicians were puzzled at the cause
[Line 1196] of his death. This is remarkable for a vertical descent of over 2,000
[Line 1197] feet.’
[Line 1198]  The flights were brought to an end by the San Francisco earthquake in
[Line 1199] April, 1906, which, Montgomery states, ‘Wrought such a disaster that I had to turn my attention to other subjects and let the aeroplane rest for a time.’ Montgomery resumed experiments in 1911 in California,
[Line 1200] and in October of that year an accident brought his work to an end.
[Line 1201] The report in the American _Aeronautics_ says that ‘a little whirlwind
[Line 1202] caught the machine and dashed it head on to the ground; Professor Montgomery landed on his head and right hip. He did not believe himself
[Line 1203] seriously hurt, and talked with his year-old bride in the tent. He
[Line 1204] complained of pains in his back, and continued to grow worse until he died.’    
[Line 1205] IX  NOT PROVEN  
[Line 1206] The early history of flying, like that of most sciences, is replete with tragedies; in addition to these it contains one mystery concerning
[Line 1207] Clement Ader, who was well known among European pioneers in the
[Line 1208] development of the telephone, and first turned his attention to the problems of mechanical flight in 1872. At the outset he favoured the
[Line 1209] ornithopter principle, constructing a machine in the form of a bird
[Line 1210] with a wing-spread of twenty-six feet; this, according to Ader’s
[Line 1211] conception, was to fly through the efforts of the operator. The result of such an attempt was past question and naturally the machine never left the ground.
[Line 1212]  A pause of nineteen years ensued, and then in 1886 Ader turned his mind to the development of the aeroplane, constructing a machine of bat-like form with a wing-spread of about forty-six feet, a weight of
[Line 1213] eleven hundred pounds, and a steam-power plant of between twenty and
[Line 1214] thirty horse-power driving a four-bladed tractor screw. On October 9th,
[Line 1215] 1890, the first trials of this machine were made, and it was alleged to have flown a distance of one hundred and sixty-four feet. Whatever
[Line 1216] truth there may be in the allegation, the machine was wrecked through
[Line 1217] deficient equilibrium at the end of the trial. Ader repeated the construction, and on October 14th, 1897, tried out his third machine
[Line 1218] at the military establishment at Satory in the presence of the French
[Line 1219] military authorities, on a circular track specially prepared for the experiment. Ader and his friends alleged that a flight of nearly a thousand feet was made; again the machine was wrecked at the end of the
[Line 1220] trial, and there Ader’s practical work may be said to have ended, since
[Line 1221] no more funds were forthcoming for the subsidy of experiments.
[Line 1222]  There is the bald narrative, but it is worthy of some amplification. If Ader actually did what he claimed, then the position which the Wright
[Line 1223] Brothers hold as first to navigate the air in a power-driven plane is nullified. Although at this time of writing it is not a quarter of a century since Ader’s experiment in the presence of witnesses competent
[Line 1224] to judge on his accomplishment, there is no proof either way, and
[Line 1225] whether he was or was not the first man to fly remains a mystery in the story of the conquest of the air.
[Line 1226] The full story of Ader’s work reveals a persistence and determination to solve the problem that faced him which was equal to that of
[Line 1227] Lilienthal. He began by penetrating into the interior of Algeria after having disguised himself as an Arab, and there he spent some months in
[Line 1228] studying flight as practised by the vultures of the district. Returning to France in 1886 he began to construct the ‘Eole,’ modelling it, not on the vulture, but in the shape of a bat. Like the Lilienthal and
[Line 1229] Pilcher gliders this machine was fitted with wings which could be folded; the first flight made, as already noted, on October 9th, 1890,
[Line 1230] took place in the grounds of the chateau d’Amainvilliers, near Bretz;
[Line 1231] two fellow-enthusiasts named Espinosa and Vallier stated that a flight
[Line 1232] was actually made; no statement in the history of aeronautics has been
[Line 1233] subject of so much question, and the claim remains unproved. 
[Line 1234] It was in September of 1891 that Ader, by permission of the Minister of
[Line 1235] War, moved the ‘Eole’ to the military establishment at Satory for the
[Line 1236] purpose of further trial. By this time, whether he had flown or not, his nineteen years of work in connection with the problems attendant on mechanical flight had attracted so much attention that henceforth his work was subject to the approval of the military authorities, for
[Line 1237] already it was recognised that an efficient flying machine would confer an inestimable advantage on the power that possessed it in the event
[Line 1238] of war. At Satory the ‘Eole’ was alleged to have made a flight of 109
[Line 1239] yards, or, according to another account, 164 feet, as stated above, in the trial in which the machine wrecked itself through colliding with some carts which had been placed near the track--the root cause of this
[Line 1240] accident, however, was given as deficient equilibrium.  Whatever the sceptics may say, there is reason for belief in the
[Line 1241] accomplishment of actual flight by Ader with his first machine in the fact that, after the inevitable official delay of some months, the French War Ministry granted funds for further experiment. Ader named his second machine, which he began to build in May, 1892, the ‘Avion,’
[Line 1242] and--an honour which he well deserves--that name remains in French aeronautics as descriptive of the power-driven aeroplane up to this day. 
[Line 1243] This second machine, however, was not a success, and it was not until 1897 that the second ‘Avion,’ which was the third power-driven
[Line 1244] aeroplane of Ader’s construction, was ready for trial. This was
[Line 1245] fitted with two steam motors of twenty horse-power each, driving two
[Line 1246] four-bladed propellers; the wings warped automatically: that is to say,
[Line 1247] if it were necessary to raise the trailing edge of one wing on the turn, the trailing edge of the opposite wing was also lowered by the
[Line 1248] same movement; an undercarriage was also fitted, the machine running on three small wheels, and levers controlled by the feet of the aviator
[Line 1249] actuated the movement of the tail planes.  On October the 12th, 1897, the first trials of this ‘Avion’ were made in the presence of General Mensier, who admitted that the machine made several hops above the ground, but did not consider the performance as
[Line 1250] one of actual flight. The result was so encouraging, in spite of the partial failure, that, two days later, General Mensier, accompanied by General Grillon, a certain Lieutenant Binet, and two civilians named respectively Sarrau and Leaute, attended for the purpose of giving the machine an official trial, over which the great controversy regarding
[Line 1251] Ader’s success or otherwise may be said to have arisen.  [Illustration: Course of the Avion’s Flight, October 14, 1897.] 
[Line 1252] We will take first Ader’s own statement as set out in a very competent account of his work published in Paris in 1910. Here are Ader’s own words: ‘After some turns of the propellers, and after travelling a few
[Line 1253] metres, we started off at a lively pace; the pressure-gauge registered
[Line 1254] about seven atmospheres; almost immediately the vibrations of the rear wheel ceased; a little later we only experienced those of the front
[Line 1255] wheels at intervals. Unhappily, the wind became suddenly strong, and
[Line 1256] we had some difficulty in keeping the “Avion” on the white line. We
[Line 1257] increased the pressure to between eight and nine atmospheres, and
[Line 1258] immediately the speed increased considerably, and the vibrations of the
[Line 1259] wheels were no longer sensible; we were at that moment at the point marked G in the sketch; the “Avion” then found itself freely supported
[Line 1260] by its wings; under the impulse of the wind it continually tended to
[Line 1261] go outside the (prepared) area to the right, in spite of the action of the rudder. On reaching the point V it found itself in a very critical
[Line 1262] position; the wind blew strongly and across the direction of the white line which it ought to follow; the machine then, although still going forward, drifted quickly out of the area; we immediately put over the
[Line 1263] rudder to the left as far as it would go; at the same time increasing the pressure still more, in order to try to regain the course. The
[Line 1264] “Avion” obeyed, recovered a little, and remained for some seconds
[Line 1265] headed towards its intended course, but it could not struggle against
[Line 1266] the wind; instead of going back, on the contrary it drifted farther and farther away. And ill-luck had it that the drift took the direction
[Line 1267] towards part of the School of Musketry, which was guarded by posts and
[Line 1268] barriers. Frightened at the prospect of breaking ourselves against these obstacles, surprised at seeing the earth getting farther away from under the “Avion,” and very much impressed by seeing it rushing
[Line 1269] sideways at a sickening speed, instinctively we stopped everything.
[Line 1270] What passed through our thoughts at this moment which threatened a tragic turn would be difficult to set down. All at once came a great shock, splintering, a heavy concussion: we had landed.’
[Line 1271] Thus speaks the inventor; the cold official mind gives out a different account, crediting the ‘Avion’ with merely a few hops, and to-day,
[Line 1272] among those who consider the problem at all, there is a little group
[Line 1273] which persists in asserting that to Ader belongs the credit of the first power-driven flight, while a larger group is equally persistent in stating that, save for a few ineffectual hops, all three wheels of the machine never left the ground. It is past question that the ‘Avion’
[Line 1274] was capable of power-driven flight; whether it achieved it or no
[Line 1275] remains an unsettled problem.  [Illustration: Clement Ader’s ‘Avion,’ with wings partly folded.]
[Line 1276] Ader’s work is negative proof of the value of such experiments as Lilienthal, Pilcher, Chanute, and Montgomery conducted; these four set
[Line 1277] to work to master the eccentricities of the air before attempting to use it as a supporting medium for continuous flight under power; Ader
[Line 1278] attacked the problem from the other end; like many other experimenters he regarded the air as a stable fluid capable of giving such support to his machine as still water might give to a fish, and he reckoned that he had only to produce the machine in order to achieve flight. The wrecked ‘Avion’ and the refusal of the French War Ministry to grant any more funds for further experiment are sufficient evidence of the need for working along the lines taken by the pioneers of gliding rather than on those which Ader himself adopted. 
[Line 1279] Let it not be thought that in this comment there is any desire to derogate from the position which Ader should occupy in any study of
[Line 1280] the pioneers of aeronautical enterprise. If he failed, he failed
[Line 1281] magnificently, and if he succeeded, then the student of aeronautics does him an injustice and confers on the Brothers Wright an honour
[Line 1282] which, in spite of the value of their work, they do not deserve. There
[Line 1283] was one earlier than Ader, Alphonse Penaud, who, in the face of a lesser disappointment than that which Ader must have felt in gazing on
[Line 1284] the wreckage of his machine, committed suicide; Ader himself, rendered unable to do more, remained content with his achievement, and with the
[Line 1285] knowledge that he had played a good part in the long search which must eventually end in triumph. Whatever the world might say, he himself was certain that he had achieved flight. This, for him, was perforce enough.  Before turning to consideration of the work accomplished by the
[Line 1286] Brothers Wright, and their proved conquest of the air, it is necessary
[Line 1287] first to sketch as briefly as may be the experimental work of Sir (then
[Line 1288] Mr) Hiram Maxim, who, in his book, _Artificial and Natural Flight_, has
[Line 1289] given a fairly complete account of his various experiments. He began by experimenting with models, with screw-propelled planes so attached to a horizontal movable arm that when the screw was set in motion the plane described a circle round a central point, and, eventually, he built a
[Line 1290] giant aeroplane having a total supporting area of 1,500 square feet, and a wing-span of fifty feet. It has been thought advisable to give a fairly full description of the power plant used to the propulsion
[Line 1291] of this machine in the section devoted to engine development. The aeroplane, as Maxim describes it, had five long and narrow planes
[Line 1292] projecting from each side, and a main or central plane of pterygoid
[Line 1293] aspect. A fore and aft rudder was provided, and had all the auxiliary planes been put in position for experimental work a total lifting surface of 6,000 square feet could have been obtained. Maxim, however,
[Line 1294] did not use more than 4,000 square feet of lifting surface even in his
[Line 1295] later experiments; with this he judged the machine capable of lifting
[Line 1296] slightly under 8,000 lbs. weight, made up of 600 lbs. water in the boiler and tank, a crew of three men, a supply of naphtha fuel, and the weight of the machine itself.  Maxim’s intention was, before attempting free flight, to get as much
[Line 1297] data as possible regarding the conditions under which flight must
[Line 1298] be obtained, by what is known in these days as ‘taxi-ing’--that is, running the propellers at sufficient speed to drive the machine along the ground without actually mounting into the air. He knew that he had an immense lifting surface and a tremendous amount of power in his
[Line 1299] engine even when the total weight of the experimental plant was taken
[Line 1300] into consideration, and thus he set about to devise some means of
[Line 1301] keeping the machine on the nine foot gauge rail track which had been constructed for the trials. At the outset he had a set of very heavy
[Line 1302] cast-iron wheels made on which to mount the machine, the total weight
[Line 1303] of wheels, axles, and connections being about one and a half tons. These were so constructed that the light flanged wheels which supported
[Line 1304] the machine on the steel rails could be lifted six inches above the track, still leaving the heavy wheels on the rails for guidance of
[Line 1305] the machine. ‘This arrangement,’ Maxim states, ‘was tried on several
[Line 1306] occasions, the machine being run fast enough to lift the forward end off the track. However, I found considerable difficulty in starting
[Line 1307] and stopping quickly on account of the great weight, and the amount of
[Line 1308] energy necessary to set such heavy wheels spinning at a high velocity.
[Line 1309] The last experiment with these wheels was made when a head wind was blowing at the rate of about ten miles an hour. It was rather unsteady,
[Line 1310] and when the machine was running at its greatest velocity, a sudden
[Line 1311] gust lifted not only the front end, but also the heavy front wheels
[Line 1312] completely off the track, and the machine falling on soft ground was
[Line 1313] soon blown over by the wind.’
[Line 1314]  Consequently, a safety track was provided, consisting of squared pine
[Line 1315] logs, three inches by nine inches, placed about two feet above the steel way and having a thirty-foot gauge. Four extra wheels were fitted
[Line 1316] to the machine on outriggers and so adjusted that, if the machine should lift one inch clear of the steel rails, the wheels at the ends
[Line 1317] of the outriggers would engage the under side of the pine trackway.  The first fully loaded run was made in a dead calm with 150 lbs. steam
[Line 1318] pressure to the square inch, and there was no sign of the wheels
[Line 1319] leaving the steel track. On a second run, with 230 lbs. steam pressure
[Line 1320] the machine seemed to alternate between adherence to the lower and upper tracks, as many as three of the outrigger wheels engaging at the same time, and the weight on the steel rails being reduced practically
[Line 1321] to nothing. In preparation for a third run, in which it was intended
[Line 1322] to use full power, a dynamometer was attached to the machine and
[Line 1323] the engines were started at 200 lbs. pressure, which was gradually
[Line 1324] increased to 310 lbs per square inch. The incline of the track, added to the reading of the dynamometer, showed a total screw thrust of 2,164 lbs. After the dynamometer test had been completed, and everything had been made ready for trial in motion, careful observers were stationed
[Line 1325] on each side of the track, and the order was given to release the
[Line 1326] machine. What follows is best told in Maxim’s own words:--
[Line 1327]  ‘The enormous screw-thrust started the engine so quickly that it nearly threw the engineers off their feet, and the machine bounded over
[Line 1328] the track at a great rate. Upon noticing a slight diminution in the
[Line 1329] steam pressure, I turned on more gas, when almost instantly the steam
[Line 1330] commenced to blow a steady blast from the small safety valve, showing that the pressure was at least 320 lbs. in the pipes supplying the
[Line 1331] engines with steam. Before starting on this run, the wheels that were to engage the upper track were painted, and it was the duty of one of my assistants to observe these wheels during the run, while another
[Line 1332] assistant watched the pressure gauges and dynagraphs. The first part of the track was up a slight incline, but the machine was lifted clear
[Line 1333] of the lower rails and all of the top wheels were fully engaged on the
[Line 1334] upper track when about 600 feet had been covered. The speed rapidly
[Line 1335] increased, and when 900 feet had been covered, one of the rear axle
[Line 1336] trees, which were of two-inch steel tubing, doubled up and set the rear end of the machine completely free. The pencils ran completely across the cylinders of the dynagraphs and caught on the underneath end. The rear end of the machine being set free, raised considerably above the track and swayed. At about 1,000 feet, the left forward wheel
[Line 1337] also got clear of the upper track, and shortly afterwards the right
[Line 1338] forward wheel tore up about 100 feet of the upper track. Steam was at once shut off and the machine sank directly to the earth, embedding
[Line 1339] the wheels in the soft turf without leaving any other marks, showing
[Line 1340] most conclusively that the machine was completely suspended in the
[Line 1341] air before it settled to the earth. In this accident, one of the pine timbers forming the upper track went completely through the lower framework of the machine and broke a number of the tubes, but no damage was done to the machinery except a slight injury to one of the screws.’  It is a pity that the multifarious directions in which Maxim turned
[Line 1342] his energies did not include further development of the aeroplane, for it seems fairly certain that he was as near solution of the problem
[Line 1343] as Ader himself, and, but for the holding-down outer track, which was really the cause of his accident, his machine would certainly have achieved free flight, though whether it would have risen, flown and alighted, without accident, is matter for conjecture.  The difference between experiments with models and with full-sized
[Line 1344] machines is emphasised by Maxim’s statement to the effect that with a small apparatus for ascertaining the power required for artificial flight, an angle of incidence of one in fourteen was most advantageous,
[Line 1345] while with a large machine he found it best to increase his angle to
[Line 1346] one in eight in order to get the maximum lifting effect on a short
[Line 1347] run at a moderate speed. He computed the total lifting effect in the experiments which led to the accident as not less than 10,000 lbs., in
[Line 1348] which is proof that only his rail system prevented free flight.  
[Line 1349] X
[Line 1350] SAMUEL PIERPOINT LANGLEY   Langley was an old man when he began the study of aeronautics, or, as
[Line 1351] he himself might have expressed it, the study of aerodromics, since he
[Line 1352] persisted in calling the series of machines he built ‘Aerodromes,’ a word now used only to denote areas devoted to use as landing spaces for flying machines; the Wright Brothers, on the other hand, had the great
[Line 1353] gift of youth to aid them in their work. Even so it was a great race between Langley, aided by Charles Manly, and Wilbur and Orville Wright, and only the persistent ill-luck which dogged Langley from the start
[Line 1354] to the finish of his experiments gave victory to his rivals. It has been proved conclusively in these later years of accomplished flight
[Line 1355] that the machine which Langley launched on the Potomac River in October of 1903 was fully capable of sustained flight, and only the accidents incurred in launching prevented its pilot from being the first man to
[Line 1356] navigate the air successfully in a power-driven machine.
[Line 1357] The best account of Langley’s work is that diffused throughout a weighty tome issued by the Smithsonian Institution, entitled the _Langley Memoir on Mechanical Flight_, of which about one-third was written by Langley himself, the remainder being compiled by Charles
[Line 1358] M. Manly, the engineer responsible for the construction of the first radial aero engine, and chief assistant to Langley in his experiments. To give a twentieth of the contents of this volume in the present short account of the development of mechanical flight would far exceed
[Line 1359] the amount of space that can be devoted even to so eminent a man in
[Line 1360] aeronautics as S. P. Langley, who, apart from his achievement in the
[Line 1361] construction of a power-driven aeroplane really capable of flight, was a scientist of no mean order, and who brought to the study of aeronautics the skill of the trained investigator allied to the
[Line 1362] inventive resource of the genius. 
[Line 1363] That genius exemplified the antique saw regarding the infinite capacity for taking pains, for the Langley Memoir shows that as early as 1891
[Line 1364] Langley had completed a set of experiments, lasting through years, which proved it possible to construct machines giving such a velocity
[Line 1365] to inclined surfaces that bodies indefinitely heavier than air could
[Line 1366] be sustained upon it and propelled through it at high speed. For full
[Line 1367] account (very full) of these experiments, and of a later series leading up to the construction of a series of ‘model aerodromes’ capable of
[Line 1368] flight under power, it is necessary to turn to the bulky memoir of Smithsonian origin.
[Line 1369] [Illustration: Quarter-size model, Langley Aerodrome, in flight, 8th August, 1903.  Langley Memoir on Mechanical Flight, Smithsonian Institution,
[Line 1370] Washington.] 
[Line 1371] The account of these experiments as given by Langley himself reveals the humility of the true investigator. Concerning them, Langley remarks
[Line 1372] that, ‘Everything here has been done with a view to putting a trial
[Line 1373] aerodrome successfully in flight within a few years, and thus giving an
[Line 1374] early demonstration of the only kind which is conclusive in the eyes of the scientific man, as well as of the general public--a demonstration that mechanical flight is possible--by actually flying. All that has
[Line 1375] been done has been with an eye principally to this immediate result, and all the experiments given in this book are to be considered only as approximations to exact truth. All were made with a view, not to some remote future, but to an arrival within the compass of a few years at some result in actual flight that could not be gainsaid or mistaken.’
[Line 1376] With a series of over thirty rubber-driven models Langley demonstrated
[Line 1377] the practicability of opposing curved surfaces to the resistance of the
[Line 1378] air in such a way as to achieve flight, in the early nineties of last
[Line 1379] century; he then set about finding the motive power which should permit of the construction of larger machines, up to man-carrying size. The internal combustion engine was then an unknown quantity, and he had to
[Line 1380] turn to steam, finally, as the propulsive energy for his power plant. The chief problem which faced him was that of the relative weight and
[Line 1381] power of his engine; he harked back to the Stringfellow engine of 1868, which in 1889 came into the possession of the Smithsonian Institution
[Line 1382] as a historical curiosity. Rightly or wrongly Langley concluded on
[Line 1383] examination that this engine never had developed and never could
[Line 1384] develop more than a tenth of the power attributed to it; consequently
[Line 1385] he abandoned the idea of copying the Stringfellow design and set about
[Line 1386] making his own engine. 
[Line 1387] How he overcame the various difficulties that faced him and constructed
[Line 1388] a steam-engine capable of the task allotted to it forms a story in itself, too long for recital here. His first power-driven aerodrome of model size was begun in November of 1891, the scale of construction
[Line 1389] being decided with the idea that it should be large enough to carry an automatic steering apparatus which would render the machine capable of maintaining a long and steady flight. The actual weight of the first
[Line 1390] model far exceeded the theoretical estimate, and Langley found that a
[Line 1391] constant increase of weight under the exigencies of construction was
[Line 1392] a feature which could never be altogether eliminated. The machine was
[Line 1393] made principally of steel, the sustaining surfaces being composed of silk stretched from a steel tube with wooden attachments. The first engines were the oscillating type, but were found deficient in power.
[Line 1394] This led to the construction of single-acting inverted oscillating engines with high and low pressure cylinders, and with admission and exhaust ports to avoid the complication and weight of eccentric and
[Line 1395] valves. Boiler and furnace had to be specially designed; an analysis of sustaining surfaces and the settlement of equilibrium while in
[Line 1396] flight had to be overcome, and then it was possible to set about the construction of the series of model aerodromes and make test of their
[Line 1397] ‘lift.’
[Line 1398]  By the time Langley had advanced sufficiently far to consider it possible to conduct experiments in the open air, even with these models, he had got to his fifth aerodrome, and to the year 1894. Certain tests resulted in failure, which in turn resulted in further
[Line 1399] modifications of design, mainly of the engines. By February of 1895 Langley reported that under favourable conditions a lift of nearly sixty per cent of the flying weight was secured, but although this was much more than was required for flight, it was decided to postpone trials until two machines were ready for the test. May, 1896, came
[Line 1400] before actual trials were made, when one machine proved successful and
[Line 1401] another, a later design, failed. The difficulty with these models was that of securing a correct angle for launching; Langley records how, on
[Line 1402] launching one machine, it rose so rapidly that it attained an angle of
[Line 1403] sixty degrees and then did a tail slide into the water with its engines
[Line 1404] working at full speed, after advancing nearly forty feet and remaining in the air for about three seconds. Here, Langley found that he had
[Line 1405] to obtain greater rigidity in his wings, owing to the distortion of
[Line 1406] the form of wing under pressure, and how he overcame this difficulty
[Line 1407] constitutes yet another story too long for the telling here.
[Line 1408] Field trials were first attempted in 1893, and Langley blamed his
[Line 1409] launching apparatus for their total failure. There was a brief, but at
[Line 1410] the same time practical, success in model flight in 1894, extending to between six and seven seconds, but this only proved the need for
[Line 1411] strengthening of the wing. In 1895 there was practically no advance toward the solution of the problem, but the flights of May 6th and
[Line 1412] November 28th, 1896, were notably successful. A diagram given in Langley’s memoir shows the track covered by the aerodrome on these two flights; in the first of them the machine made three complete circles, covering a distance of 3,200 feet; in the second, that of November 28th, the distance covered was 4,200 feet, or about three-quarters of a mile, at a speed of about thirty miles an hour.  These achievements meant a good deal; they proved mechanically propelled flight possible. The difference between them and such experiments as were conducted by Clement Ader, Maxim, and others,
[Line 1413] lay principally in the fact that these latter either did or did not
[Line 1414] succeed in rising into the air once, and then, either willingly or by compulsion, gave up the quest, while Langley repeated his experiments and thus attained to actual proof of the possibilities of flight.
[Line 1415] Like these others, however, he decided in 1896 that he would not
[Line 1416] undertake the construction of a large man-carrying machine. In addition
[Line 1417] to a multitude of actual duties, which left him practically no time
[Line 1418] available for original research, he had as an adverse factor fully ten years of disheartening difficulties in connection with his model machines. It was President McKinley who, by requesting Langley to undertake the construction and test of a machine which might finally
[Line 1419] lead to the development of a flying machine capable of being used in warfare, egged him on to his final experiment. Langley’s acceptance of the offer to construct such a machine is contained in a letter addressed from the Smithsonian Institution on December 12th, 1898, to the Board of Ordnance and Fortification of the United States War Department; this letter is of such interest as to render it worthy of
[Line 1420] reproduction:--  ‘Gentlemen,--In response to your invitation I repeat what I had the honour to say to the Board--that I am willing, with the consent of
[Line 1421] the Regents of this Institution, to undertake for the Government the further investigation of the subject of the construction of a flying machine on a scale capable of carrying a man, the investigation to include the construction, development and test of such a machine under conditions left as far as practicable in my discretion, it being
[Line 1422] understood that my services are given to the Government in such time
[Line 1423] as may not be occupied by the business of the Institution, and without
[Line 1424] charge.  ‘I have reason to believe that the cost of the construction will come
[Line 1425] within the sum of $50,000·00, and that not more than one-half of that will be called for in the coming year.  ‘I entirely agree with what I understand to be the wish of the Board that privacy be observed with regard to the work, and only when it
[Line 1426] reaches a successful completion shall I wish to make public the fact of
[Line 1427] its success.  ‘I attach to this a memorandum of my understanding of some points of detail in order to be sure that it is also the understanding of the
[Line 1428] Board, and I am, gentlemen, with much respect, your obedient servant,
[Line 1429] S. P. Langley.’ 
[Line 1430] One of the chief problems in connection with the construction of a full-sized apparatus was that of the construction of an engine, for it was realised from the first that a steam power plant for a
[Line 1431] full-sized machine could only be constructed in such a way as to make it a constant menace to the machine which it was to propel. By this
[Line 1432] time (1898) the internal combustion engine had so far advanced as to convince Langley that it formed the best power plant available.
