[Line 1] Nathan was famous at making work for everybody, and loafers rarely appealed to him in vain.  How such an exceedingly busy man could find
[Line 2] it in his heart to sympathise with drones, none knew.  It was another of the anomalies of Mr. Baskerville's character.  But he often proved good for a square meal, a day's labour and a night's rest, as many
[Line 3] houseless folk well knew.
[Line 4] "You're the joker who calls himself the 'Duke of Drake's Island,' aren't you?"
[Line 5] "The Duke of Drake's Island" grinned and nodded.  He was a worthless soul, very well known to the Devon constabulary. 
[Line 6] "Get up to the village and call at 'The White Thorn' in an hour from
[Line 7] now, and ask for me."  "Thank you kindly, Mr. Baskerville."
[Line 8]  "We'll see about that later.  I can find a job for you to-night; but it
[Line 9] ain't picking primroses."  Priscilla Lintern met her landlord at the gate of Undershaugh.  They
[Line 10] were on terms of intimacy, and nodded to each other in an easy and friendly manner.  She had been feeding poultry from a basin, and now set it down, wiped her fingers on her apron, and shook hands with Ned
[Line 11] Baskerville.
[Line 12] "How be you, then?  'Tis a longful time since you called on us, Master Ned."
[Line 13] "I'm clever, thank you; and I see you are, Mrs. Lintern.  And I hope Cora and Phyllis be all right too.  Heathman here be growing as strong
[Line 14] as a lion--ban't you, Heathman?"
[Line 15]  Mrs. Lintern was a brown, good-looking woman of rather more than fifty.
[Line 16] For twenty years she had farmed Undershaugh, and her power of reserve surprised a garrulous village.  It was taken by the sensible for wisdom
[Line 17] and by the foolish for pride.  She worked hard, paid her rent at the hour it was due, as Nathan often mentioned to her credit, and kept her own counsel.  Very little was known about her, save that she had come to Shaugh as a widow with three young children, that she was kind-hearted and might have married Mr. Gollop a year after her arrival, but had declined the honour. 
[Line 18] Her daughters were at dinner when the men entered, and both rose and saluted Ned with some self-consciousness.  Phyllis, the younger, was
[Line 19] like her mother: brown, neat, silent and reserved; the elder was cast
[Line 20] in a larger mould and might have been called frankly beautiful.
[Line 21] Cora was dark, with black eyes and a fair skin whose purity she took pains to preserve.  She was tall, straight and full in the bosom.  Her mouth alone betrayed her, for the lips set close and they were rather thin; but people forgot them when she laughed and showed her pretty
[Line 22] teeth.  Her laugh again belied her lips, for it was gentle and
[Line 23] pleasant.  She had few delusions for a maiden, and she worked hard.  To Cora belonged a gift of common-sense.  The girl lacked sentiment, but she was shrewd and capable.  She kept her mother's books and displayed
[Line 24] a talent for figures.  It was said that she had the brains of the family.  Only Mr. Baskerville himself doubted it, and maintained that
[Line 25] Cora's mother was the abler woman.  Phyllis was lost at all times in
[Line 26] admiration of her more brilliant sister, but Heathman did not like Cora
[Line 27] and often quarrelled with her.
[Line 28] Ned gave his message and asked for a drink of cider.  Thereupon Phyllis rose from her dinner and went to fetch it.  But young Baskerville's eyes were on Cora while he drank.  He had the manner of a man very well
[Line 29] accustomed to female society, and long experience had taught him that
[Line 30] nine girls out of ten found him exceedingly attractive.  His easy insolence won them against their will.  Such girls as demanded worship and respect found Ned not so agreeable; but those who preferred the male creature to dominate were fascinated by his sublimity and
[Line 31] affectation of knowledge and worldly wisdom.  He pretended to know everything--a convincing attitude only among those who know nothing.
[Line 32]  The talk was of a revel presently to take place at Tavistock.  "And
[Line 33] what's your gown going to be, Phyllis?" asked Ned.  The gown of Phyllis did not interest him in the least, but this question was put as a preliminary to another, and when the younger sister told him that she meant to wear plum-colour, he turned to Cora. 
[Line 34] "Cora's got a lovely frock--blue muslin wi' little pink roses, and a
[Line 35] straw hat wi' big pink roses," said Phyllis.
[Line 36] Ned nodded.
[Line 37]  "I'd go a long way to see her in such a beautiful dress," he said; "and, mind, I'm to have a dance or two with you both.  There's to be dancing in the evening--not rough and tumble on the grass, but boards
[Line 38] are to be laid down and everything done proper." 
[Line 39] They chattered about the promised festivity, while Nathan and Mrs. Lintern, having discussed certain farm matters, spoke of another and a nearer celebration.  "You see, my brother Vivian and I are of the good old-fashioned sort, and we're bent on the whole family meeting at a square feed, with good wishes all round, on his seventieth birthday.  To think of him turned
[Line 40] seventy!  I can't believe it.  Yet Time won't stand still--not even with the busiest.  A family affair 'tis to be, and none asked outside
[Line 41] ourselves."
[Line 42] "Does Mr. Humphrey go?  He's not much of a hand at a revel."
[Line 43]  "He is not; and I thought that he would have refused the invitation. But he's accepted.  We shall try our hardest to cheer him up and get a
[Line 44] drop of generous liquor into him.  I only hope he won't be a damper and
[Line 45] spoil the fun." 
[Line 46] "A pity he's going."  "We shall know that better afterwards.  'Twill be a pity if he mars
[Line 47] all; but 'twill be a good thing if we overmaster him amongst us, and get him to take a hopefuller view of life and a kinder view of his
[Line 48] fellow-creatures." 
[Line 49] Ned chimed in.
[Line 50] "You'll never do that, Uncle Nat.  He's too old to change now.  And Cousin Mark be going just the same way.  He's getting such a silent,
[Line 51] hang-dog chap, and no wonder, having to live with such a father.  I'd
[Line 52] run away if I was him."  Nathan laughed.
[Line 53] "I believe you'd almost rather work than keep along with your Uncle Humphrey," he said. 
[Line 54] "'Tis pretty well known I can work when I choose," declared Ned.  "Yes," said Heathman, with his mouth full; "and 'tis also pretty well
[Line 55] known you never do choose."
[Line 56] The elder Baskerville clapped his hands.
[Line 57]  "One to you, Heathman!" he said.  "Ned can't deny the truth of that."  But Ned showed no concern.
[Line 58]  "I shall make up for lost time very easily when I do start," he said. "I've got ideas, I believe, and they go beyond ploughing.  I'm like Cora here--all brains.  You may laugh, Uncle Nat, but you're not the only Baskerville with a head on your shoulders.  I'll astonish you yet."
[Line 59] "You will--you will--the day you begin to work, Ned; and the sooner the
[Line 60] better.  I shall be very glad when it happens."
[Line 61] The women laughed, and Cora much admired Ned's lofty attitude.  She too
[Line 62] had ambitions, and felt little sympathy with those who were content to labour on the soil.  She strove often to fire her brother and enlarge
[Line 63] his ambitions; but he had the farmer's instinct, enjoyed physical work, and laughed at her airs and graces.  "Give me Rupert," said Heathman now.  "He's like me--not much good at talking and ain't got no use for the girls, but a towser to work."  "The man who ain't got no use for the girls is not a man," declared Ned very positively.  "They're the salt of the earth--ban't they, Mrs. Lintern?"
[Line 64] She smiled and looked at him curiously, then at his uncle; but she did
[Line 65] not answer. 
[Line 66] "Anyway," continued Ned, "you're out when you say Rupert's like you; for hard worker that he is, he's found time for a bit of love-making."
[Line 67] Cora and Phyllis manifested instant excitement and interest at this news.
[Line 68]  "Who is she?  You must tell us," said the elder. 
[Line 69] "Why, I will; but say nought, for nothing be known about it outside the families, and Rupert haven't said a word himself to me.  I reckon he
[Line 70] don't guess that I know.  But such things can't be hid from my eyes--too sharp for that, I believe.  'Tis Milly Luscombe, if you must know.  A very nice little thing too in her way.  Not my sort--a bit too
[Line 71] independent.  I like a girl to feel a man's the oak to her ivy, but----"
[Line 72]  Uproarious laughter from his uncle cut Ned short. 
[Line 73] "Mighty fine oak for a girl's ivy--you!" he said.
[Line 74]  "You wait," repeated the younger.  "Anyway, Rupert be sweet on Milly, and father knows all about it, and won't hear of it.  So there's thunder in the air for the moment."
[Line 75]  They discussed this interesting private news, but promised Ned not to
[Line 76] retail it in any ear.  Then he left them and, with Nathan, returned to the village.
[Line 77]  Ned, undeterred by Mr. Baskerville's raillery, began loudly to praise Cora as soon as they had passed beyond earshot of the farmhouse-door.
[Line 78] "By Jove, she's a bowerly maiden and no mistake!  Not her like this
[Line 79] side of Plymouth, I do believe.  Haven't seen her for a month of
[Line 80] Sundays, and she's come on amazing."
[Line 81]  "She's a very handsome girl without a doubt," admitted Nathan.  "And a very clever girl too; but a word in your ear, my young shaver: you mustn't look that way once and for all."  "Why not, if I choose?  I'm a free man." 
[Line 82] "You may be--now--more shame to you.  But Cora--well, your cousin Mark be first in the field there.  A word to the wise is enough.  You'll be doing a very improper thing if you look in that quarter, and I must firmly beg you won't, for everybody's sake." 
[Line 83] "Mark!"  "Mark.  And a very good chap he is--worth fifty of you."
[Line 84]  "Mark!" repeated Ned, as though the notion was unthinkable.  "I should have guessed that he would rather have run out of the country than lift his eyes to a girl!"   
[Line 85]  CHAPTER IV
[Line 86]  The Reverend Dennis Masterman was a bachelor.  He came to Shaugh full of physical energy and certain hazy resolutions to accomplish notable work among a neglected people.  His scholastic career was nugatory, and his intellect had offered no bar to his profession.  He was physically
[Line 87] brave, morally infirm.  Therefore his sister, Alice Masterman, came to support him and share his lot and complement his character.  She might
[Line 88] indeed fly from cows, but she would not fly from parochial opposition.
[Line 89] She was strong where he was weak.  They were young, sanguine, and of
[Line 90] gentle birth.  They enjoyed private means, but were filled with
[Line 91] wholesome ardour to justify existence and leave the world better than they found it.  Dennis Masterman possessed interest, and regarded this,
[Line 92] his first cure, as a stepping-stone to better things.
[Line 93]  Shaugh Prior was too small for his natural energies and powers of
[Line 94] endurance--so he told his sister; but she said that the experience would be helpful.  She also suspected that reform might not be a matter of energy alone.
[Line 95]  One evening, a week after their arrival, they were planning the campaign and estimating the value of lay helpers, when two important visitors were announced.  A maiden appeared and informed the clergyman that Thomas Gollop and Eliza Gollop desired to see him.  "Show them into the common room," said he; then he twisted a little bronze cross that he wore at his watchchain and regarded Miss Masterman.
[Line 96] "The parish clerk and his sister--I wonder if you'd mind, Alice?" he asked.
[Line 97]  For answer she put down her work.
[Line 98]  "Certainly.  Since you saw Joe Voysey alone and, not only engaged him, but promised he might have a boy for the weeding, I feel--well, you are a great deal too easy, Dennis.  Gollop is a very masterful person, clearly, and his sister, so I am told, is just the same.  You certainly must not see women alone.  They'll get everything they want out of you."
[Line 99]  "Of course, one wishes to strike a genial note," he explained.  "First
[Line 100] impressions count for such a lot with common people."  "Be genial by all means; I say nothing against that."
[Line 101] "Let's tackle them, then.  Gollop's a tremendous Conservative, but we must get Liberal ideas into him, if we can--in reason."
[Line 102]  Dennis Masterman was tall, square-shouldered and clean-shaven.  He
[Line 103] regarded himself as somewhat advanced, but had no intention of sowing
[Line 104] his opinions upon the parish before the soil was prepared.  He
[Line 105] considered his character to be large-minded, tolerant, and sane; and
[Line 106] for a man of eight-and-twenty he enjoyed fair measure of these virtues. 
[Line 107] His sister was plain, angular, and four years older than Dennis.  She
[Line 108] wore double eyeglasses and had a gruff voice and a perceptible beard.
[Line 109] The Gollops rose as the vicar and his sister appeared.  Miss Gollop was
[Line 110] shorter and stouter than her brother, but resembled him.
[Line 111] "Good evening, your reverence; good evening, miss," said the parish
[Line 112] clerk.  "This is my sister, Miss Eliza.  For faith, hope, and charity
[Line 113] she standeth.  In fact, a leading light among us, though I say it as
[Line 114] should not."
[Line 115]  Mr. Masterman shook hands with the woman; his sister bowed only.
[Line 116]  "And what does Miss Gollop do?" asked Dennis.
[Line 117] "'Twould be easier to say what she don't do," answered Thomas.  "She's butt-woman to begin with, or as you would call it, 'pew-opener.'  Then
[Line 118] she's sick-nurse to the parish, and she's midwife, and, when free,
[Line 119] she'll do chores or cook for them as want her.  And she's got a
[Line 120] knowledge and understanding of the people round these parts as won't be beaten.  She was Mr. Valletort's right hand, wasn't you, Eliza?"
[Line 121]  "So he said," answered Miss Gollop.  She was not self-conscious, but bore herself as Fame's familiar and one accustomed to admiration.  She had estimated the force of the clergyman's character from his first
[Line 122] sermon, and judged that her brother would be a match for him.  Now she
[Line 123] covertly regarded Miss Masterman, and perceived that here must lie any
[Line 124] issue of battle that might arise.  "Do you abide along with your brother, miss, or be you just settling him into the vicarage?" she asked.
[Line 125]  "I live with him." 
[Line 126] Miss Gollop inclined her head. 
[Line 127] "And I'm sure I hope, if I can serve you any way at any time, as you'll let me know."  "Thank you.  Everybody can serve us: we want help from one and all," said Mr. Masterman.  "Ezacally so!" said Thomas.  "And you must larn each man's value from
[Line 128] those that know it--not by bitter experience.  Likewise with the women. My sister can tell you, to threepence a day, what any female in this parish be good for; and as to the men, you'll do very well to come to
[Line 129] me.  I know 'em all--old and young--and their characters and their points--good and bad, crooked and odd.  For we've got some originals among us, and I'm not going to deny it, haven't us, Eliza?"  "Every place have," she said. 
[Line 130] "Might we sit down?" asked the man.  "We'm of the bungy breed, as you
[Line 131] see, and not so clever in our breathing as we could wish.  But we'm
[Line 132] here to go through the whole law and the prophets, so to speak, and we can do it better sitting."  "Please sit down," answered Dennis.  Then he looked at his watch.  "I
[Line 133] can give you an hour," he said.  "But I'm going to ride over to
[Line 134] Bickleigh at nine o'clock, to see the vicar there."
[Line 135] "And a very nice gentleman you'll find him," declared Thomas.  "Of
[Line 136] course, Bickleigh be but a little matter beside Shaugh Prior.  We bulk
[Line 137] a good deal larger in the eyes of the nation, and can hold our heads so much the higher in consequence; but the Reverend Coaker is a very good, humble-minded man, and knows his place in a way that's a high example to the younger clergymen." 
[Line 138] Miss Masterman cleared her throat, but her voice was none the less gruff.
[Line 139]  "Perhaps you will now tell us what you have come for.  We are busy
[Line 140] people," she said.
[Line 141] Her brother deprecated this brevity and tried to tone it down, but
[Line 142] Thomas accepted the lady's statement with great urbanity.
[Line 143]  "Miss be right," he answered.  "Busy as bees, I warrant--same as me and my own sister here.  She don't wear out many chairs, do you, Eliza?"
[Line 144]  "Not many," said Miss Gollop.  "I always say, 'Let's run about in this world; plenty of time to sit down in the next.'" 
[Line 145] "I may tell you," added Thomas kindly, "that your first sermon went
[Line 146] down very suent.  From where I sits, along by the font, I can get a
[Line 147] good look across the faces, and the important people, the Baskervilles and the Lillicraps and the Luscombes and the Mumfords--one and all listened to every word, and nodded now and again.  You'll be glad to know that."
[Line 148] "Some thought 'twas a sermon they'd heard afore, however," said Miss Gollop; "but no doubt they was wrong."  "Quite wrong," declared Dennis warmly.  "It was a sermon written only
[Line 149] the night before I preached it.  And talking of the font----"  "Yes, of course, you've marked the famous font-cover over the holy basin, I suppose?" interrupted Mr. Gollop.  "'Tis the joy and pride of
[Line 150] the church-town, I assure you.  Not another like it in the world, they say.  Learned men come all across England to see it--as well they may."
[Line 151] The famous font-cover, with its eight little snub-nosed saints and the Abbot elevated in the midst, was a special glory of St. Edward's.  "I meant to speak of that," said the clergyman.  "The figure at the top has got more than his proper vestments on, Gollop.  In fact, he's
[Line 152] wrapped up in cobwebs.  That is not worthy of us.  Please see they are cleaned off."
[Line 153]  "I hadn't noticed them; but since you say so--I'll look to it myself. Where the vamp-dish be concerned I allow none to meddle.  It shall be done; but I must say again that I haven't noticed any cobwebs--not last Sunday.  Have you, Eliza?" said Thomas.
[Line 154] "No, I have not," answered his sister.
[Line 155]  "The dirt has clearly been there for months," remarked Miss Masterman. 
[Line 156] There was a painful pause, during which Miss Gollop gazed at the
[Line 157] vicar's sister and then at the vicar.
[Line 158]  "'Tis a well-known fact that spiders will spin," she said vaguely, but
[Line 159] not without intention.  The other woman ignored her and turned to Thomas. 
[Line 160] "Will you be so good as to proceed?"
[Line 161]  "Yes, and gladly, miss," he answered.  "And I'll begin with the Gollops, since they've done as much for this parish as anybody, living
[Line 162] or dead.  My father was parish clerk afore me, and a very remarkable man, wasn't he, Eliza?"  "He was."  "A remarkable man with a large faith in the power of prayer, was father.  You don't see such faith now, worse luck.  But he believed
[Line 163] more than even I hold to, or my sister, either.  You might say that he
[Line 164] wasn't right always; but none ever dared to doubt the high religious quality of the man.  But there he was--a pillar of the Church and
[Line 165] State, as they say.  He used to help his money a bit by the power of
[Line 166] prayer; and they fetched childer sick of the thrush to him; and he'd tak 'em up the church tower and hold 'em over the battlements, north, south, east, and west--while he said the Lord's Prayer four times.
[Line 167] He'd get a shilling by it every time, and was known to do twenty of 'em in a good year, though I never heard 'twas a very quick cure.  But faith moves mountains, and he may have done more good than appeared to
[Line 168] human eyes.  And then in his age, he very near let a heavy babby drop
[Line 169] over into the churchyard--just grabbed hold of un by a miracle and saved un.  So that proper terrified the old man, and he never done another for fear of some lasting misfortune.  Not but what a few devilish-natured people said that if 'twas knowed he let the childer
[Line 170] fall now and again, he'd brisk up his business a hundred per centum.
[Line 171] Which shows the evil-mindedness of human nature."  "I'll have no gross superstition of that sort here," said Mr. Masterman
[Line 172] firmly.
[Line 173] "No more won't I," answered Thomas.  "'Other times, other manners,' as
[Line 174] the saying is.  Have no fear.  The church is very safe with me and Eliza for watch-dogs.  Well, so much for my father.  There was only us two, and we never married--too busy for that.  And we've done no little for Shaugh Prior, as will be better told you in good time by other mouths than ours."
[Line 175] He stopped to take breath, and Miss Masterman spoke.  "My brother will tell you that with regard to parish clerks the times are altering too," she said.
[Line 176]  "And don't I know it?" he answered.  "Why, good powers, you can't get a clerk for love or money nowadays!  They'm regular dying out.  'He'll be
[Line 177] thankful he've got one of the good old sort,' I said to my sister. 'For he'd have had to look beyond Dartymoor for such another as me.' And so he would."
[Line 178]  "That's true," declared Miss Gollop.  "I mean that the congregation takes the place of the clerk in most
[Line 179] modern services," continued Miss Masterman.  "In point of fact, we shall not want exactly what you understand by a 'clerk.'  'Other times,
[Line 180] other manners,' as you very wisely remarked just now."
[Line 181] Mr. Gollop stared.  "Not want a clerk!" he said.  "Woman alive, you must be daft!"  "I believe not," answered Miss Masterman.  "However, what my brother has got to say regarding his intentions can come later.  For the
[Line 182] present he will hear you." 
[Line 183] "If you don't want a clerk, I've done," answered Mr. Gollop blankly.
[Line 184] "But I'll make bold to think you can't ezacally mean that.  Us'll leave it, and I'll tell my tale about the people.  The Lillicraps be a harmless folk, and humble and fertile as coneys.  You'll have no
[Line 185] trouble along with them.  The Baskervilles be valuable and powerful;
[Line 186] and Mr. Humphrey and his son is Church, and Mr. Vivian and his family
[Line 187] is Church also, and his darters sing in the choir."
[Line 188] "We shall manage without women in the choir," said Miss Masterman.
[Line 189]  "You may think so, but I doubt it," answered Eliza Gollop almost
[Line 190] fiercely.  "You'll have to manage without anybody in the church also, if you be for up-turning the whole order of divine service!"  She was excited, and her large bosom heaved.
[Line 191]  "Not up-turning--not up-turning," declared the clergyman.  "Call it
[Line 192] reorganisation.  Frankly, I propose a surpliced choir.  I have the bishop's permission; he wishes it.  Now, go on."
[Line 193] "Then the Lord help you," said Thomas.  "We'd better be going, Eliza. We've heard almost enough for one evening."  "Be reasonable," urged Miss Masterman with admirable self-command.  "We are here to do our duty.  We hope and expect to be helped by all
[Line 194] sensible people--not hindered.  Let Mr. Gollop tell us what he came to
[Line 195] tell us."
[Line 196] "Well--as to reason--I ask no more, but where is it?" murmured Thomas.
[Line 197] "'Twas the Baskervilles," he continued, wiping his forehead.  "The
[Line 198] other of 'em--Nathan--be unfortunately a chapel member; and if you be
[Line 199] going to play these here May games in the House of the Lord, I'm very
[Line 200] much afeared he'll draw a good few after him.  They won't stand
[Line 201] it--mark me."
[Line 202] "Where do the people at Undershaugh worship?  I did not see Mrs. Lintern and her family last Sunday."
[Line 203] "They'm all chapel too."
[Line 204] Mr. Masterman nodded.  "Thank you for these various facts.  Is there anything more?"  "I've only just begun.  But I comed with warnings chiefly.  There be
[Line 205] six Radicals in this parish, and only six."  "Though the Lord knows how many there will be when they hear about the choir," said Eliza Gollop.  "I'm an old-fashioned Liberal myself," declared the vicar.  "But I hope
[Line 206] your Radicals are sound churchmen, whatever else they may be."
[Line 207]  "Humphrey Baskerville is--and so's his son."  "Is that young Mark Baskerville?"  "Yes--tenor bell among the ringers.  A very uneven-minded man.  He's a
[Line 208] wonderful ringer and wrapped up in tenor bell, as if 'twas a heathen idol.  In fact, he'm not the good Christian he might be, and he'll ring
[Line 209] oftener than he'll pray.  Then Saul Luscombe to Trowlesworthy
[Line 210] Warren--farmer and rabbit-catcher--be a very hard nut, and so's his
[Line 211] man, Jack Head.  You won't get either of them inside the church.  They
[Line 212] say in their wicked way they ain't got no need for sleeping after breakfast of a Sunday--atheists, in fact.  The other labouring man from
[Line 213] Trowlesworthy is a good Christian, however.  He can read, but 'tis
[Line 214] doubtful whether he can write."  "You'll have to go to keep your appointment, Dennis," remarked his sister.  "Plenty of time.  Is there anything more that's particularly important,
[Line 215] Gollop?"  "Lots more.  Still, if I'm to be shouted down every minute----  I comed to encourage and fortify you.  I comed to tell you to have no fear,
[Line 216] because me and sister was on your side, and always ready to fight to
[Line 217] the death for righteousness.  But you've took the wind out of our
[Line 218] sails, in a manner of speaking.  If you ban't going to walk in the old
[Line 219] paths, I'm terrible afraid you'll find us against you."
[Line 220]  "This is impertinence," said Miss Masterman.  "Not at all," answered the clerk's sister.  "It's sense.  'Tis a free country, and if you'm going to set a lot of God-fearing, right-minded,
[Line 221] sensible people by the ears, the sin be on your shoulders.  You'd best to come home, Thomas."
[Line 222] Mr. Masterman looked helplessly at his watch.
[Line 223] "We shall soon arrive at--at--a _modus vivendi_," he said.
[Line 224] "I don't know what that may be, your reverence," she answered; "but if 'tis an empty church, and sour looks, and trouble behind every hedge,
[Line 225] then you certainly will arrive at it--and even sooner than you think
[Line 226] for." 
[Line 227] "He's going to give ear to the Radicals--'tis too clear," moaned
[Line 228] Thomas, as he rose and picked up his hat. 
[Line 229] "I can only trust that you two good people do not represent the parish," continued the vicar. 
[Line 230] "You'll terrible soon find as we do," said Miss Gollop.  "So much the worse.  However, it is well that we understand one another.  Next Sunday I shall invite my leading parishioners to meet me
[Line 231] in the schoolroom on the following evening.  I shall then state my intentions, and listen to the opinions and objections of every man
[Line 232] among you." 
[Line 233] "And only the men will be invited to the meeting," added Miss Masterman. 
[Line 234] "'Tis a parlous come-along-of-it," moaned the parish clerk.  "I meant
[Line 235] well.  You can bear me out, Eliza, that I meant well--never man meant
[Line 236] better." 
[Line 237] "Good evening," said Miss Masterman, and left them.
[Line 238]  "Be sure that we shall soon settle down," prophesied the vicar.  "I
[Line 239] know you mean well, Gollop; and I mean well, too.  Where sensible
[Line 240] people are concerned, friction is reduced to a minimum.  We shall very
[Line 241] soon understand one another and respect one another's opinions."  "If you respect people's opinions, you abide by 'em," declared Miss Gollop. 
[Line 242] "Us shan't be able to keep the cart on the wheels--not with a
[Line 243] night-gowned choir," foretold her brother.  Then Dennis saw them to the door; they took their leave, and as they went down the vicarage drive, their voices bumbled together, like two
[Line 244] slow, shard-borne beetles droning on the night. 
[Line 245]  CHAPTER V
[Line 246] Both the yeoman and gentle families of Devon have undergone a wide and deep disintegration during the recent past.  Many are swept away, and the downfall dates back beyond the eighteenth century, when war, dice, and the bottle laid foundations of subsequent ruin; but the descendants of many an ancient stock are still with us, and noble names shall be
[Line 247] found at the plough-handle; historical patronymics, on the land.  The race of Baskerville had borne arms and stood for the king in Stuart times.  The family was broken in the Parliamentary Wars and languished
[Line 248] for certain centuries; then it took heart and lifted head once more. The three brothers who now carried on their line were doubly enriched, for their father had died in good case and left a little fortune behind him; while an uncle, blessed with some tincture of the gipsy blood that
[Line 249] had flowed into the native stock a hundred years before, found Devon too small a theatre for his activities and migrated to Australia.  He
[Line 250] died a bachelor, and left his money to his nephews.
[Line 251] Thus the trio began life under fortunate circumstances; and it appeared
[Line 252] that two had prospered and justified existence; while concerning the other little could be affirmed, save a latent and general dislike
[Line 253] founded on vague hearsay. 
[Line 254] They were different as men well could be, yet each displayed strong
[Line 255] individuality and an assertive temperament.  All inherited some
[Line 256] ancestral strength, but disparities existed between their tastes, their judgments, and their ambitions.
[Line 257]  Vivian Baskerville was generous, self-opinionated, and kind-hearted.
[Line 258] He loved, before all things, work, yet, in direct opposition to this ruling passion, tolerated and spoiled a lazy eldest son.  From the rest of his family he exacted full measure of labour and very perfect
[Line 259] obedience.  He was a man of crystallised opinions--one who resented
[Line 260] change, and built on blind tradition.
[Line 261] Nathan Baskerville had a volatile and swift-minded spirit.  He was
[Line 262] sympathetic, but not so sympathetic as his manner made him appear.  He had a histrionic knack to seem more than he felt; yet this was not all acting, but a mixture of art and instinct.  He trusted to tact, to a sense of humour with its accompanying tolerance, and to swift appraisal
[Line 263] of human character.  Adaptability was his watchword.
[Line 264] Humphrey Baskerville personified doubt.  His apparent chill indifference crushed the young and irritated the old.  An outward gloominess of manner and a pessimistic attitude to affairs sufficed to turn the folk from him.  While he seemed the spirit of negation made
[Line 265] alive, he was, nevertheless, a steadfast Christian, and his dark mind,
[Line 266] chaotic though it continued to be even into age, enjoyed one precious
[Line 267] attribute of chaos and continued plastic and open to impressions.  None understood this quality in him.  He did not wholly understand it himself.  But he was ever seeking for content, and the search had thus far taken him into many fruitless places and landed him in blind alleys not a few.
[Line 268]  These adventures, following his wife's death, had served to sour him in some directions; and the late ripening of a costive but keen
[Line 269] intelligence did not as yet appear to his neighbours.  It remained to be seen whether time would ever achieve a larger wisdom, patience, and understanding in him--whether considerable mental endowments would ultimately lift him nearer peace and content, or plunge him deeper into
[Line 270] despondence and incorrigible gloom.  He was as interesting as Nathan was attractive and Vivian, obvious.
[Line 271]  The attitude of the brothers each to the other may be recorded in a
[Line 272] sentence.  Vivian immensely admired the innkeeper and depended no little upon his judgment in temporal affairs, but Humphrey he did not
[Line 273] understand; Nathan patronised his eldest brother and resented
[Line 274] Humphrey's ill-concealed dislike; while the master of Hawk House held Vivian in regard, as an honest and single-minded man, but did not share
[Line 275] the world's esteem for Nathan.  They always preserved reciprocal amenities and were accounted on friendly terms.
[Line 276] Upon the occasion of the eldest brother's seventieth birthday, both
[Line 277] Vivian and Nathan stood at the outer gate of Cadworthy and welcomed
[Line 278] Humphrey when he alighted off his semi-blind pony.  Years sat lightly on the farmer.  He was a man of huge girth and height above the average.  He had a red moon face, with a great fleshy jowl set in white whiskers.  His brow was broad and low; his small, pig-like eyes twinkled with kindliness.  It was a favourite jest with him that he weighed within a stone or two as much as his brothers put together.
[Line 279] They shook hands and went in, while Mark and Rupert took the ponies.
[Line 280] The three brothers all wore Sunday black; and Vivian had a yellow tie on that made disharmony with the crimson of his great cheeks.  This mountain of a man walked between the others, and Nathan came to his ear
[Line 281] and Humphrey did not reach his shoulder.  The last looked a mere shadow
[Line 282] beside his brother.
[Line 283]  "Seventy year to-day, and have moved two ton of sacks--a hundredweight
[Line 284] to the sack--'twixt breaksis and noon.  And never felt better than this
[Line 285] minute," he told them. 
[Line 286] "'Tis folly, all the same--this heavy work that you delight in," declared Nathan.  "I'm sure Humphrey's of my mind.  You oughtn't to do
[Line 287] such a lot of young man's work.  'Tis foolish and quite uncalled for." 
[Line 288] "The young men can't do it, maybe," said Humphrey.  "Vivian be three
[Line 289] men rolled into one--with the strength of three for all his threescore
[Line 290] and ten years.  But you're in the right.  He's too old for these deeds. There's no call for weight-lifting and all this sweating labour, though he is such a mighty man of his hands still."
[Line 291] Mr. Baskerville of Cadworthy laughed.  "You be such brainy blids--the pair of you--that you haven't got no patience with me and my schoolboy fun.  But, then, I never had no
[Line 292] intellects like you--all ran into muscle and bone.  And 'tis my
[Line 293] pleasure to show the young generation what strength be.  The Reverend Masterman preached from a very onusual text Sunday, 'There were giants
[Line 294] in those days,' it was--or some such words, if my memory serves me.
[Line 295] And Rupert and May, as were along with me, said as surely I belonged to the giant race!"  He laughed with a loud, simple explosion of ingenuous merriment, and
[Line 296] led the way to the parlour.  There his wife, in black silk, welcomed her brothers-in-law and received their congratulations.  Humphrey fumbled at a parcel which he
[Line 297] produced from his breast.  He untied the string, wound it up, and put
[Line 298] it into his pocket.
[Line 299]  "'Tis a book as I heard well spoken of," he said.  "There's only one
[Line 300] Book for you and me, I believe, Vivian; but an old man as I know came
[Line 301] by this, and he said 'twas light in his darkness; so I went and bought
[Line 302] a copy for you by way of something to mark the day.  Very like 'tis all rubbish, and if so you can throw it behind the fire."
[Line 303]  "Sermons, and good ones without a doubt," answered the farmer.  "I'm
[Line 304] very fond of sermons, and I'll lay on to 'em without delay and let you know what I think.  Not that my opinion of such a thing do count; but I
[Line 305] can tell to a hair if they'm within the meaning of Scripture, and that
[Line 306] be all that matters.  And thank you kindly, I'm sure."  "Tom Gollop's got terrible down-daunted about Mr. Masterman," said Nathan.  "He says that your parson is a Radical, and will bring down
[Line 307] dreadful things on the parish."
[Line 308] "Old fool," answered Humphrey.  "'Tis just what we want, within the meaning of reason, to have a few of the cobwebs swept away."
[Line 309]  "But you're a Radical too, and all for sweeping away," argued his
[Line 310] eldest brother doubtfully. 
[Line 311] "I'm for folly and nonsense being swept away, certainly.  I'm for all this cant about humility and our duty to our superiors being swept
[Line 312] away.  I hate to see chaps pulling their hair to other men no better
[Line 313] than themselves, and all that knock-kneed, servile rubbish."
[Line 314]  Nathan felt this to be a challenge. 
[Line 315] "We take off our hats to the blood in a man's veins, if 'tis blue
[Line 316] enough--not to the man."
[Line 317] "And hate the man all the time, maybe--and so act a lie when we cap to
[Line 318] him and pretend what isn't true."
[Line 319]  "You go too far," declared Nathan. 
[Line 320] "I say that we hate anything that's stronger than we are," continued
[Line 321] his brother.  "We hate brains that's stronger than our own, or pockets that's deeper.  The only folk that we smile upon honestly be those we
[Line 322] reckon greater fools than ourselves."  Vivian laughed loud at this.
[Line 323]  "What a sharp tongue the man hath!" he exclaimed.  "But he's wrong, for
[Line 324] all that.  For if I only smiled at them who had less brains than
[Line 325] myself, I should go glum from morn till night."
[Line 326]  "Don't say it, father!" cried his wife.  "Too humble-minded you be, and
[Line 327] always will be."
[Line 328] "'Tis only a very wise man that knows himself for a fool, all the
[Line 329] same," declared Nathan.  "As for Humphrey here, maybe 'tis because men hate brains bigger than their own, as he says, that he hasn't got a larger circle of friends himself.  We all know he's the cleverest man among us."  Humphrey was about to speak again, but restrained the inclination and turned to his nieces who now appeared.
[Line 330] Polly lacked character and existed as the right hand of her mother; but May took physically after Vivian, and represented his first joy and the apple of his eye.  She was a girl of great breadth and bulk every way. The beauty of youth still belonged to her clean white and red face, and her yellow hair was magnificent; but it required no prophet to foretell that poor May, when her present colt-like life of physical activity
[Line 331] decreased, must swiftly grow too vast for her own comfort or the
[Line 332] temptation of the average lover. 
[Line 333] The youngest of the family--his Uncle Humphrey's namesake--followed his sisters.  He was a brown boy, well set up and shy.  Of all men he
[Line 334] feared the elder Humphrey most.  Now he shook hands evasively.
[Line 335]  "Don't stare at the ceiling and the floor, but look me in the eyes.  I
[Line 336] hate a chap as glances athwart his nose like that," said the master of Hawk House.  Whereat the lesser Humphrey scowled and flushed.  Then he
[Line 337] braced himself for the ordeal and stared steadily into his uncle's eyes.  The duel lasted full two minutes, and the boy's father laughed and applauded him.  At last young Humphrey's eyes fell.
[Line 338] "That's better," said Humphrey the elder.  "You learn to keep your gaze
[Line 339] on the eyes of other people, my lad, if you want to know the truth
[Line 340] about 'em.  A voice will teach you a lot, but the eyes are the book for
[Line 341] me--eh, Nathan?"
[Line 342] "No doubt there's a deal in that." 
[Line 343] "And if 'twas followed, perhaps we shouldn't take our hats off to
[Line 344] certain people quite so often as we do," added Humphrey, harking back
[Line 345] to the old grievance.  "What's the good of being respectful to those
[Line 346] you don't respect and ought not to respect?"  "The man's hungry!" said Vivian.  "'Tis starvation making him so crusty
[Line 347] and so clever.  Come now, ban't dinner ready?"
[Line 348] Mrs. Baskerville had departed and Polly with her. 
[Line 349] "Hurry 'em up," cried Vivian, and his youngest son hastened to do so.  Meantime Nathan, who was also hungry, and who also desired to display agility of mind before his elder brother, resumed the argument with Humphrey and answered his last question.
[Line 350]  "Because we've everything to gain by being civil, and nought to gain by being otherwise, as things are nowadays.  Civility costs nothing and
[Line 351] the rich expect it of the poor, and gentle expect it of simple.  Why
[Line 352] not?  You can't mar them by being rude; but you can mar yourself.  'The
[Line 353] golden rule for a pushing man is to be well thought upon.'  That's what
[Line 354] our father used to say.  And it's sound sense, if you ask me.  Of
[Line 355] course, I'm not speaking for us, but for the younger generation, and if they can prosper by tact and civility to their betters, why not?  We
[Line 356] like the younger and humbler people to be civil to us; then why shouldn't they be civil to parson and squire?"  "How if parson be no good, and squire a drinker or a rascal?" 
[Line 357] "That's neither here nor there.  'Tis their calling and rank and the
[Line 358] weight behind 'em." 
[Line 359] "Trash!" said Humphrey sourly.  "Let every man be weighed in his own balance and show himself what he is.  That's what I demand.  Why should we pretend and give people the credit of what they stand for, if they
[Line 360] don't stand for it?"
[Line 361] "For a lot of reasons----" began Nathan; then the boy Humphrey returned
[Line 362] to say that dinner was ready.  They sat down, and through the steam that rose from a dish of ducks Humphrey looked at Nathan and spoke.
[Line 363]  "What reasons?" he said.  "For your credit's sake you can't leave it
[Line 364] there."
[Line 365]  "If you will have it, you will have it--though this isn't the time or
[Line 366] place; but Vivian must blame you, not me.  Life's largely a game of
[Line 367] make-believe and pretence, and, right or wrong, we've got to suffer it.
[Line 368] We should all be no better than lonely monkeys or Red Indians, if we
[Line 369] didn't pretend a bit more than we meant and say a bit more than we'd swear to.  Monkeys don't pretend, and what's the result?  They've all
[Line 370] gone under." 
[Line 371] They wrangled until the food was on the plates, then Vivian, who had been puffing out his cheeks, rolling his eyes and showing uneasiness in
[Line 372] other ways, displayed a sudden irritability.  "God damn it!" he cried.  "Let's have no more of this!  Be the meal to be sarved with no sauce but all this blasted nonsense?  Get the drink,
[Line 373] Rupert."
[Line 374]  Nathan expressed instant regret and strove to lift the tone of the
[Line 375] company.  But the cloud did not pass so easily.  Vivian himself soon forgot the incident; his children and his wife found it difficult.  The
[Line 376] young people, indeed, maintained a very dogged taciturnity and only
[Line 377] talked among themselves in subdued tones.  May and Polly waited upon the rest between the intervals of their own meal.  They changed the dishes and went to and from the kitchen.  Rupert and his youngest brother helped them, but Ned did not.
[Line 378]  Some cheerfulness returned with the beer, and even Humphrey Baskerville
[Line 379] strove to assist the general jollity; but he lacked the power.  His mind was of the discomfortable sort that cannot suffer opinions,
[Line 380] believed erroneous, to pass unchallenged.  Sometimes he expressed no
[Line 381] more than doubt; sometimes he dissented forcibly to Nathan's generalities.  But after Vivian's heat at the beginning of the
[Line 382] entertainment, his brother from 'The White Thorn' was cautious, and took care to raise no more dust of controversy.
[Line 383] The talk ran on the new vicar, and the master of Cadworthy spoke well of him.
[Line 384]  "An understanding man, and for my part, though I can't pretend to like new things, yet I ban't going to quarrel for nothing.  And if he likes to put the boys in surplices and make the maidens sit with the congregation, I don't see no great harm.  They can sing praises to God wi' their noses to the east just so easy as they can facing north."  "Well said," declared Humphrey.  "I've no patience with such fools as Gollop."  "As one outside and after a different persuasion, I can look on impartial," declared Nathan.  "And I think with you both that Masterman is a useful and promising man.  As for Gollop, he's the sort that can't
[Line 385] see further than the end of the parish, and don't want to do so."  "For why?  He'd tell you there's nought beyond," said Humphrey.  "He
[Line 386] foxes himself to think that the world can go on without change.  He fancies that he alone of us all be a solid lighthouse, stuck up to watch the waves roll by.  'Tis a sign of a terrible weak intellect to
[Line 387] think that everybody's changeable but ourselves, and that we only be
[Line 388] the ones that know no shadow of changing.  Yet I've seen many such men--with a cheerful conceit of themselves too."
[Line 389]  "There's lots like that--common as blackberries in my bar," declared Nathan.  "Old fellows most times, that reckon they are the only
[Line 390] steadfast creatures left on earth, while everybody else be like
[Line 391] feathers blown about in a gale of change."  "Every mortal man and woman be bound to change," answered his brother.
[Line 392] "'Tis the law of nature.  I'd give nought for a man of hard and fast opinions.  Such stand high and dry behind the times." 
[Line 393] But Vivian would not allow this.
[Line 394] "No, no, Humphrey; that won't do.  If us wasn't fixed and firm, the world couldn't go on." 
[Line 395] "Vivian means we must have a lever of solid opinions to lift our load in the world," explained Nathan.  "Of course, no grown man wants to be
[Line 396] flying to a new thing every day of his life, like the young people do."
[Line 397]  "The lever's the Bible," declared Humphrey.  "I've nought to do with
[Line 398] any man who goes beyond that; but, outside that, there's a margin for
[Line 399] change as the world grows, and 'tis vain to run your life away from the new facts the wise men find out."
[Line 400] "I don't hold with you," declared Vivian.  "At such a gait us would never use the same soap or wear the same clothes two years together.
[Line 401] If you'm going to run your life by the newspapers, you'm in the same
[Line 402] case with the chaps and the donkey in the fable.  What father believed
[Line 403] and held to, I shall believe and hold to; for he was a better man than
[Line 404] me and knowed a lot more."
[Line 405]  Humphrey shook his head. 
[Line 406] "If we all thought so, the world would stand still," he replied.  "'Tis
[Line 407] the very argument pushed in the papers to-day about teaching the young
[Line 408] people.  'Tis said they must be taught just what their parents want for 'm to be taught.  And who knows best, I should like to know--the
[Line 409] parents and guardians, as have finished their learning years ago and be
[Line 410] miles behind-hand in their knowledge, or the schoolmasters and mistresses as be up to date in their larning and full of the latest
[Line 411] things put into books?  There's no standing still with the world any more than there's standing still with the sun.  It can't be.  Law's against it."
[Line 412] "We must have change," admitted Nathan.
[Line 413]  "For sure we must.  'Tis the only way to keep sweet--like water running
[Line 414] forward.  If you block it in a pond, it goes stagnant; and if you block
[Line 415] your brains, they rot."
[Line 416]  "Then let us leave it at that," said Vivian's wife.  "And now, if you
[Line 417] men have done your drink, you can go off and smoke while we tidy up."
[Line 418]  But there was yet a duty to perform, and Nathan rose and whispered in Humphrey's ear.
[Line 419]  "I think the time's come for drinking his health.  It must be done. Will you propose it?"
[Line 420]  His brother answered aloud.
[Line 421] "Nathan wants for me to propose your good health, Vivian.  But I ban't going to.  That sort of thing isn't in my line.  I wish you nought but
[Line 422] well, and there's an end on't."
[Line 423] "Then I'll say a word," declared the innkeeper, returning to his place.
[Line 424] "Fill your glasses--just a drop more, Hester, you must drink--isn't it
[Line 425] to your own husband?  And I say here, in this family party, that 'tis a
[Line 426] proud and a happy thing to have for the head of the family such a man
[Line 427] as our brother--your husband, Hester; and your father, you boys and girls.  Long may he be spared to stand up among us and set us a good
[Line 428] example of what's brave and comely in man; long may he be spared, I say, and from my heart I bless him for a good brother and husband and
[Line 429] father, and wish him many happy returns of his birthday.  My love and honour to you, Vivian!" 
[Line 430] They all rose and spoke after the custom of the clan.
[Line 431] "My love and honour to you, brother," said Humphrey. 
[Line 432] "My love and honour to you, Vivian Baskerville," said his wife. 
[Line 433] "Love and honour to you, father," murmured the boys and girls. 
[Line 434] And Mark said, "Love and honour to you, uncle." 
[Line 435] There was a gulching of liquor in the silence that followed, and Mr.
[Line 436] Baskerville's little eyes twinkled.  "You silly folk!" he said.  "God knows there's small need of this.  But
[Line 437] thank you all--wife, children, brothers, and nephew.  I be getting up home to my tether's end now, and can't look with certainty for over and
[Line 438] above another ten birthdays or thereabouts; but such as come we'll keep
[Line 439] together, if it pleases you.  And if you be drinking, then here's to you all at a breath--to you all, not forgetting my son Nathan that's sailing on the sea."  "I'll write to Nat and tell him every blessed word of it, and what we've had for dinner and all," said May.
[Line 440]  The company grew hilarious and Nathan, leaving them, went to the trap
[Line 441] that had brought him from Shaugh Prior and returned with a bottle.
[Line 442] "'Tis a pretty cordial," he said, "and a thimbleful all round will steady what's gone and warm our hearts.  Not but what they'm warm enough already."
[Line 443]  The liquor was broached and all drank but Humphrey.  "Enough's as good as a feast.  And you can saddle my pony, Mark.  I'm going home now.  I'm glad to have been here to-day; but I'm going now." 
[Line 444] They pressed him to remain, but he judged the invitation to be
[Line 445] half-hearted.  However, he was tranquil and amiable at leave-taking. To Rupert he even extended an invitation.  Rupert was the only one of his brother's family for whom he even pretended regard.  "You can come and see me when you've got the time," he said.  "I'll go for a walk along with you and hear what you have to say."  Then he rode off, but Mark stopped and finished the day with his cousins.
[Line 446] He talked to Rupert and, with secret excitement, heard the opinions of
[Line 447] May and Polly on the subject of Cora Lintern.
[Line 448]  A very glowing and genial atmosphere settled over Cadworthy after the
[Line 449] departure of Humphrey Baskerville.  Even the nervous Mark consented to
[Line 450] sing a song or two.  The musical traditions of the Baskervilles had reawakened in him, and on rare occasions he favoured his friends with old ballads.  But in church he never sang, and often only went there to
[Line 451] ring the tenor bell.
[Line 452]  Mr. Nathan also rendered certain comic songs, and May played the aged piano.  Then there was dancing and dust and noise, and presently the meal called 'high tea.'  Hester Baskerville protested at last against her brother-in-law's absurdities, for everybody began to roll about and
[Line 453] ache with laughter; but he challenged her criticism. 
[Line 454] "Clever though you all are," he said, "no woman that ever I met was clever enough to play the fool.  'Tis only the male creature can accomplish that." 
[Line 455] "No woman ever wanted to, I should hope," she answered; and he retorted triumphantly--
[Line 456] "There you are!  There's my argument in a nutshell!"  She was puzzled.
[Line 457]  "What d'you mean by that?" she asked, and, from the standpoint of his
[Line 458] nimble wit, he roared.
[Line 459]  "There you are again!" he said.  "I can't explain; but the lack in you
[Line 460] be summed in the question."  "You'm a hopeless case," she said.  "We all laugh at you, and yet
[Line 461] couldn't for the life of us tell what on earth 'tis we be laughing at."
[Line 462] "That's the very highest art and practice of playing the fool!" he told
[Line 463] them.  
[Line 464]  CHAPTER VI
[Line 465]  Where Wigmore Down descends in mighty shoulders clad with oak, there
[Line 466] meet the rivers Plym and Mew, after their diverse journeyings on
[Line 467] Dartmoor.  The first roars wild and broken from its cradle aloft on the
[Line 468] midmost waste, and falls with thunder under Cadworthy and beneath the
[Line 469] Dewerstone; the other, as becomes a stream that has run through peaceful valleys by bridges and the hamlets of men, shall be found to wander with more gentle current before she passes into the throbbing
[Line 470] bosom of her sister.  Above them, on a day in early summer, the hill
[Line 471] ascended washed with light, spread hugely for the pomp of the leaf.  From Plym beneath, flashing arrowy under their lowermost branches, to
[Line 472] the granite tonsure of the hill above, ten thousand trees ascended in a shining raiment of all greens--a garment that fitted close to the
[Line 473] contours of each winding ridge, sharp cleeve, and uplifted knoll of the elevation that they covered.  Lustrous and shimmering, this forest garb exhibited every vernal tint that nature knows, for upon a prevalent,
[Line 474] triumphant fabric of golden-green were cast particular jewels and patterns; against the oaken undertones, where they spread a dappled
[Line 475] verdure of amber and carmine, there sprang the tardy ash, shone the rowan's brightness, sparkled the whitethorn at river's brink, and rose the emerald pavilions of the larch.  Beeches thrust their diaphanous foliage in veils athwart the shadows; here a patchwork of blue firs
[Line 476] added new harmonies to the hill; here the glittering birch reflected light from every tiny leaf; and here the holly's sobriety was broken by inflorescence and infant foliage, young and bright.
[Line 477] The forest spread its new-born leaves under a still, grey evening, upon
[Line 478] which, suddenly, the sun thrust through before it sank.  Shafts of light, falling from west to east upon the planes of the woods, struck
[Line 479] out a path of sudden glory along the pine-tops and thrust down in rain of red gold even to the river's face; while on Dewerstone's self, where it towered above the trees and broke the green with grey, this gracious light briefly brooded and flashed genial into dark crevices and hidden
[Line 480] nests of birds.
[Line 481]  The great rock falls by abrupt acclivity to the water; it towers with
[Line 482] pinnacle and peak aloft.  Planted in the side of the forest it stands veined, scarred; it is fretted with many colours, cut and torn into all
[Line 483] manner of fantastic shapes by work of roots and rain, by centuries of storm and the chisel of the lightning.  Bedded here, with ivy on its front, the smile of evening for a crown, and the forest like a green sea breaking in foam of leaves around it, the Water Stone stood.  Night was already come upon its eaves and cornices; from its feet ascended
[Line 484] musical thunder of Plym in a riot of rocks; and aloft, clashing,
[Line 485] echoing and re-echoing from scarp and precipice, there rang the cheerful chiming music of unnumbered jackdaws, who made these crags their home. 
[Line 486] Mark Baskerville, descending into the valley from Shaugh, beheld this
[Line 487] scene with understanding.  He had been well educated; he was sentimental; he regarded wild Nature in a manner rare amid those born
[Line 488] and bred upon her bosom.  Beauty did not find him indifferent; old legends gave him joy.  He knew the folk-tales of the land and dwelt
[Line 489] upon them still with pleasure--an instinct surviving from boyhood, and
[Line 490] deliberately suffered to survive.  He loved the emotion of awe and
[Line 491] cultivated it; he led a life from choice much secluded; he had walked
[Line 492] hitherto blind, in so far as women were concerned; but now a woman had
[Line 493] entered his life, and Nature shone glorified throughout by the experience.
[Line 494]  Mark was in love with Cora Lintern; yet this prime fact did not lessen his regard for the earth and the old stories concerning it.  He found
[Line 495] the things that were good aforetime still good, but changed.  His emotions were all sharpened and intensified.  His strength was
[Line 496] stronger; his weakness was weaker than of yore.  She was never out of his thoughts; she made the sunlight warmer, the bird's song sweeter,
[Line 497] the night more wonderful.  He woke and found himself brave enough to approach her in the deep, small hours of morning; but with dawn came fear, and with day his courage melted.  By night also he made rhymes
[Line 498] that seemed beautiful to him and brought moisture to his eyes; but when the sun came and he repeated his stumbling periods, he blushed at them and banished them.
[Line 499] She was friendly and not averse; but she was clever, and had many friends among young men.  Nathan Baskerville rejoiced in her, and often
[Line 500] foretold a notable match for Cora.  What Mark could offer seemed very
[Line 501] little to Mark himself.  His father, indeed, was reputed rich; but life
[Line 502] at Hawk House revealed no sign of it.  They lived hard, and Humphrey
[Line 503] Baskerville affected a frugality that would have been unusual in the homes of humbler people.
[Line 504]  Humphrey had often told his son that he did not know how to spend
[Line 505] money; and as for Mark, until the present, he had shared his father's indifference and been well content.  But he felt that Cora might be
[Line 506] fond of money; and he was glad sometimes that his father spent so
[Line 507] little; because, if all went well, there must surely come a time when
[Line 508] he would be able to rejoice Cora with great riches.  The obstacle,
[Line 509] however, he felt to be himself.  His distrust of himself was morbid;
[Line 510] the folk said that he was frightened of his own voice, and only spoke through the tenor bell of St. Edward's. 
[Line 511] Now he descended into the shadows of the valley and moved along the
[Line 512] brink of Plym, seeking for certain young wood, ripe for cutting. Presently Mark found what he sought, but made no immediate effort to
[Line 513] begin work.  He flung down a frail which contained a bill-hook and saw. Then he sat upon a rock overhanging the river and buried himself in his own thoughts.  A path wound beside the stream, and along it sauntered suddenly the maiden of this man's dream.  She looked fair enough and moved in deep apparent unconsciousness of any human presence.  But her ignorance was simulated.  She had seen young Baskerville pass over the hill; she had known his destination, and by a detour she had
[Line 514] entered the valley from below.
[Line 515] Now she started and exhibited astonishment.  "Mark!  Whoever would have thought----!  What be you doing here all
[Line 516] alone like this--and you not a fisherman?" 
[Line 517] He stammered, and grew pale.
[Line 518] "Fancy meeting; and I might ask what brought you, Cora?" 
[Line 519] "Oh, just a silly fondness for the river and the trees and my own thoughts.  I like being about among the wild things, though I dare say
[Line 520] you won't believe it."
[Line 521]  "Of course, I'll believe it--gladly too.  Don't I like being about among 'em better than anything else?  I'm very pleased to meet you, I'm
[Line 522] sure.  There's no lovelier bit of the river than here."
[Line 523]  "Dewerstone do look fine to-night," she said, glancing up at the crags above them.
[Line 524]  "It does, then.  The Water Stone I always call it, since I read in a book that that was what it meant.  'Tis the great stone by the water, you see.  Have you ever heard tell of the Black Hunter, Cora?  But
[Line 525] perhaps you don't hold with such old wife's tales?"
[Line 526] She put him at his ease and assured him that she loved ancient fables
[Line 527] and liked to go on believing them, despite her better knowledge.  "Just the same as me!" he cried eagerly.  "The very thing I do.  How
[Line 528] wonderful you should feel the same!  I know 'tis rubbish, yet I let it go sadly.  I'd believe in the pixies, if I could!" 
[Line 529] "Who was the Black Hunter, if you don't mind telling me?" she asked.
[Line 530] "I'll sit here a bit afore I go on, if it won't be to hinder you." 
[Line 531] "Proud I am, I'm sure," he said.  "And as for him, the Black Hunter,
[Line 532] that's no more than another name for the Devil himself.  'Twas thought that he'd come here by night with his great, bellowing, red-eyed dogs,
[Line 533] and go forth to hunt souls.  A coal-black horse he rode; but sometimes he'd set out afoot, for 'tis well remembered how once in the deep snow,
[Line 534] on a winter morn, human footprints, along with hoofmarks, were traced
[Line 535] to the top of the hill, but not down again!"  "The devil flew away with somebody?" 
[Line 536] "So the old story says.  But I like the thought of the little Heath
[Line 537] Hounds better.  For they hunt and harry old Nick's self.  They are the
[Line 538] spirits of the young children who die before they are baptised; and the legend hath it that they win to heaven soon or late by hunting the
[Line 539] Prince of Darkness.  'Tis the children that we bury with maimed rites
[Line 540] upon 'Chrisomers' Hill' in the churchyard.  They put that poor woman who killed herself in the same place, because the old parson wouldn't
[Line 541] read 'sure and certain hope' over her." 
[Line 542] But Cora was not interested in his conversation, though she pretended to be.  She endeavoured to turn speech into a more personal road.  "What have you come here for?  I hadn't any idea you ever took walks
[Line 543] alone."  "I take hundreds--terrible poor hand at neighbouring with people, I
[Line 544] am--like my father.  But I'm here to work--getting handles for tools. There's no wood for light tools like alder.  You know the old rhyme--    'When aller's leaf is so big as a penny,   The stick will wear so tough as any.' 
[Line 545] That's true enough, for I've proved it."
[Line 546] "Set to work and I'll watch you, if I may."
[Line 547]  "Proud, I'm sure.  And I'll see you home after.  But there's no haste. I was thinking that bare, dark corner in the garden at Undershaugh
[Line 548] might do very nice for ferns--if you'd care----?" 
[Line 549] "The very thing!  How kind to think of it.  I love the garden and the flowers.  But none else cares about them.  D'you think you could get me one of they king ferns?  But I suppose that would be too much to ask." 
[Line 550] "I'll get you more than one."
[Line 551]  "I'll try to plant 'em then, but I'm not very clever."
[Line 552]  "I'll come and make a bit of a rockery myself, if--if you like."  "'Like!"  I should love it.  But 'tis very good of you to bother about a stupid girl."
[Line 553] "Don't you say that.  Far, far from stupid.  Never was a cleverer girl, I'm sure."  She shook her head and talked about the ferns.  Then she became personal. 
[Line 554] "I've always felt somehow with you; but I suppose it ban't maidenly to
[Line 555] say such things--but I've always felt as you understood me, Mark."
[Line 556]  "Ah!" he said.  "And as for me, I've felt--God, He knows what I've felt."  The man broke off, and she smiled at him and dropped her eyes.  She
[Line 557] knew the thing that shared his heart with her, and now spoke of it.
[Line 558] "And through you I've got to love tenor bell almost as much as you do. Of a Sunday the day isn't complete till I've heard the beautiful note
[Line 559] of your bell and thought of you at the rope.  I always somehow think of you when I hear that bell; and I think of the bell when I see you!
[Line 560] Ban't that strange?"
[Line 561] "'Tis your wonderful quick mind, and you couldn't say anything to please me better." 
[Line 562] "I wanted to ask you about the bells.  I'm so ignorant; but I thought,
[Line 563] if 'twasn't silly of me, I'd ask you about 'em.  I suppose they'm awful difficult to ring?"  "Not a bit.  Only wants steady practice.  The whole business is little
[Line 564] understood, but 'tis simple enough.  I've gone into it all from the beginning, and I'm glad--very glad--you care about it.  The first thing is for a ring of bells to be in harmony with itself, and founders ought to be free to make 'em so.  The bells are never better than when they are broken out of the moulds, and every touch of the lathe, or chip of
[Line 565] the chisel, is music lost.  The thickness of the sound-bow should be
[Line 566] one-thirteenth of the diameter, you must know; but modern bells are made for cheapness.  Long in the waist and high in the shoulder they
[Line 567] should be for true fineness of sound; but they cast 'em with short waists and flat shoulders now.  'Tis easier to hang and ring them so;
[Line 568] but they don't give the same music.  My tenor is a wonderful good
[Line 569] bell--a maiden bell, as we say--one cast true, that has never had a chip at the sound-bow.  'I call the quick to church and dead to grave,'
[Line 570] is her motto.  A Pennington bell she is, and no bell-founder ever cast a better.  Every year makes her sweeter, for there's nothing improves bell-metal like time."  "I suppose it wouldn't be possible for me actually to see the bells?"
[Line 571] "It can be done and shall be," he promised.  Then he went off again.
[Line 572] "I've been in nearly every bell-cot and bell-turret in Devonshire, one time and another, and I've took a hand in change-ringing far and wide;
[Line 573] but our ring of six, for its size and weight, can't be beat in the
[Line 574] county, and there's no sweeter tenor that I've heard than mine.  And I'm very hopeful that Mr. Masterman will take my advice and have our wheels and gear looked to, and the bell-chamber cleaned out.  'Tis the
[Line 575] home of birds, and the nest litter lies feet deep up there.  The
[Line 576] ladder's all rotten too.  We ought to have stays and slides; and our
[Line 577] ropes are a bit too heavy, and lack tuftings for the sally.  I'm hopeful he'll have a care for these things."  He prattled on, for it was his subject and always loosed his tongue.
[Line 578] She was bored to death, but from time to time, when he feared that he wearied her, she assured him that her interest did not wane and was only less than his own.  He showed unusual excitement at this meeting, was lifted out of himself, and talked until grey gloaming sank over the valley and the jackdaws were silent.  Then Cora started up and declared
[Line 579] that she must return home quickly. 
[Line 580] "Listening to you has made me forget all about the time and everything," she said.  "They'll wonder whatever has befallen me."
[Line 581]  "I'll see you home," he answered.  "'Tis my fault you'll be late, and I must take the blame."
[Line 582] "And I've kept you from your work, I'm afraid."
[Line 583] "That's no matter at all.  To-morrow will do just as well for the
[Line 584] alder."  He rose and walked beside her.  She asked him to help her at one place
[Line 585] in the wood, and her cool, firm hand thrilled him.  Once or twice he thought to take this noble opportunity and utter the thing in his
[Line 586] heart; but he could not bring himself to do it.  Then, at her gate, he left her, and they exchanged many assurances of mutual thanks and
[Line 587] obligation.  He promised to bring the ferns in three days' time, and
[Line 588] undertook to spend an evening with the Linterns, build the rockery, and stay to supper with the family afterwards. 
[Line 589] He walked home treading on air, with his mind full of hope and happiness.  Cora had never been so close as on this day; she had never vouchsafed such an intimate glimpse of her beautiful spirit before. Each word, each look seemed to bring her nearer; and yet, when he reflected on his own imperfections, a wave of doubt swept coldly over him.  He supped in silence, but, after the meal, he confessed the
[Line 590] thoughts in his mind. 
[Line 591] "Never broke a twig this evening," he said.  "Was just going to begin, when who should come along but Cora Lintern." 
[Line 592] "Has she forgiven parson for turning her out of the choir?  Can't
[Line 593] practise that side-glance at the men no more now."
[Line 594] "She's not that sort, father." 
[Line 595] "Not with a face like hers?  That girl would rather go hungry than
[Line 596] without admiration and flattering.  A little peacock, and so vain as one."
[Line 597] "You're wrong there.  I'll swear it.  She's very different to what you reckon.  Why, this very evening, there she was under the Water Stone all alone--walking along by herself just for love of the place.  Often goes there, she tells me."  "Very surprised to find you there--eh?"  "That she was.  And somehow I got talking--such a silent man as me most
[Line 598] times.  But I found myself chattering about the bells and one thing and another.  We've got a lot more in common than you might think." 
[Line 599] Mr. Baskerville smoked and looked into the fire. 
[Line 600] "Well, don't be in a hurry.  I'm not against marriage for the young
[Line 601] men.  But bide your time, till you've got more understanding of women."
[Line 602]  "I'll never find another like her.  I'm sure she'd please you, father."
[Line 603]  "You'll be rich in a small way, as the world goes, presently. Remember, she knows that as well as you do." 
[Line 604] "She never speaks of money.  Just so simple and easily pleased as I am myself, for that matter.  She loves natural things--just the things you care about yourself."
[Line 605] "And very much interested in tenor bell, no doubt?" 
[Line 606] "How did you guess that?  But 'tis perfectly true.  She is; and she
[Line 607] said a very kind thing that was very hopeful to me to hear.  She said
[Line 608] that the bell always put her in mind of me, and I always put her in mind of the bell."
[Line 609]  "I wonder!  And did you tell her what was writ on the bell?" 
[Line 610] "Yes, I did, father."
[Line 611]  "And d'you know what she thought?"  Mark shook his head.  "She thought that the sooner it called you and her to church together,
[Line 612] and the sooner it called me to my grave, the pleasanter life would look for her hard eyes."  "Father!  'Tis cruel and unjust to say such things."  "Haven't I seen her there o' Sundays ever since she growed up?  There's nought tells you more about people than their ways in church.  As
[Line 613] bright as a bee and smart and shining; but hard--hard as the nether millstone, that woman's heart.  Have a care of her; that's all I'll say to you."
[Line 614]  "I hope to God you'll know her better some day, father." 
[Line 615] "And I hope you will, my lad; and I'll use your strong words too, and hope to God you'll know her better afore 'tis too late."
[Line 616] "This is cruel, and I'm bitter sorry to hear you say it," answered the young man, rising.  Then he went out and left his father alone.
[Line 617]   Elsewhere Phyllis Lintern had eagerly inquired of Cora as to the interview with the bellringer.
[Line 618]  The girls shared many secrets and were close friends.  They knew unconsciously that their brother was more to the mother than were they. Heathman adored Mrs. Lintern and never wearied of showing it; but for
[Line 619] his sisters he cared little, and they felt no interest in him. 
[Line 620] Now Phyllis sympathised with Cora's ambitions and romances.  "How was it?" she asked.  "I warrant you brought him to the scratch!"
[Line 621] "'Tis all right," declared her sister.  "'Tis so good as done.  The word was on his tongue coming up-along in the dimpsy; but it stuck in
[Line 622] his throat.  I know the signs well enough.  However, 'twill slip out
[Line 623] pretty soon, I reckon.  He's a good sort, though fidgety, but he's gotten lovely eyes.  I'll wake him up and smarten him up, too--presently."
[Line 624]    
[Line 625] CHAPTER VII 
[Line 626] When man builds a house on Dartmoor, he plants trees to protect it.
[Line 627] Sometimes they perish; sometimes they endure to shield his dwelling
[Line 628] from the riotous and seldom-sleeping winds.  Round the abode of Humphrey Baskerville stood beech and pine.  A solid old house lurked
[Line 629] beneath, like a bear in its grove.  People likened its face to the
[Line 630] master's--the grey, worn, tar-pitched roof to his hair, and the small windows on either side of the door to his eyes.  A few apple trees were in the garden, and currant and gooseberry bushes prospered indifferent
[Line 631] well beneath them.  Rhubarb and a row of elders also flourished here. The latter were permitted to exist for their fruit, and of the berries
[Line 632] Mrs. Susan Hacker, Humphrey's widowed housekeeper, made medicinal preparations supposed to possess value. 
[Line 633] Hawk House lay under a tor, and behind it the land towered to a stony waste that culminated in wild masses of piled granite, where the rowan
[Line 634] grew and the vixen laid her cubs.  From this spot one might take a
[Line 635] bird's-eye survey of Humphrey Baskerville's domain.  Gold lichens had fastened on the roof, and the folk conceited that since there was no more room in the old man's house for his money, it began to ooze out
[Line 636] through the tiles.
[Line 637]  Humphrey himself now sat on a favourite stone aloft and surveyed his
[Line 638] possessions and the scene around them.  It was his custom in fair weather to spend many hours sequestered upon the tor.  Dwarf oaks grew in the clitters, and he marked the passage of the time by their
[Line 639] activity, by the coming of migrant birds, by the appearance of the infant foxes and by other natural signs and tokens.  Beneath Hawk House
[Line 640] there subtended a great furze-clad space flanked with woods.  The Rut, as it was called, fell away to farms and fertile fields, and terminated
[Line 641] in a glen through which the little Torry river passed upon her way to
[Line 642] Plym.  Cann Wood fringed the neighbouring heights, and far away to the
[Line 643] south Laira's lake extended and Plymouth appeared--faint, grey,
[Line 644] glittering under a gauze of smoke.
[Line 645] The tor itself was loved by hawks and stoats, crows and foxes.  Not a few people, familiar with the fact that Humphrey here took his solitary walks and kept long vigils, would affirm that he held a sort of
[Line 646] converse with these predatory things and learned from them their winged and four-footed cunning.  His sympathy, indeed, was with fox and hawk rather than with hunter and hound.  He admitted it, but in no sense of companionship with craft did he interest himself in the wild creatures.
[Line 647] He made no fatuous imputation of cruelty to the hawk, or cunning to the fox.  His bent of mind, none the less, inclined him to admire their singlehanded fight for life against long odds; and thus he, too, fell
[Line 648] into fallacy; but his opinion took a practical turn and was not swiftly
[Line 649] shattered, as such emotions are apt to be, when the pitied outlaw offers to the sentimental spectator a personal taste of his quality.
[Line 650] If a hawk stooped above his chickens, he felt a sort of contempt for the screaming, flying fowls--let the hawk help itself if it could--and did not run for his gun.  Indeed, he had no gun.  As men said of this or that obstinate ancient that he had never travelled in a train, so
[Line 651] they affirmed, concerning Humphrey Baskerville, that he had never in his life fired a gun.  He sat and smoked a wooden pipe and reflected on the puzzles of his
[Line 652] days.  He knew that he was held in little esteem, but that had never
[Line 653] troubled him.  His inquiring spirit rose above his fellow-creatures; and he prided himself upon the fact, and did not see that just in this
[Line 654] particular of a flight too lofty did he fail of the landmarks and sure
[Line 655] ground he sought.
[Line 656] A discontent, in substance very distinguished and noble, imbued his
[Line 657] consciousness.  He was still seeking solace out of life and a way that
[Line 658] should lead to rest.  But he could not find it.  He was in arms on the wrong road.  He missed the fundamental fact that from humanity and service arise not only the first duties of life, but also the highest
[Line 659] rewards that life can offer.  He had little desire towards his
[Line 660] fellow-creatures.  His mind appeared to magnify their deficiencies and weakness.  He was ungenerous in his interpretation of motives.  Mankind
[Line 661] awoke his highest impatience.  He sneered at his own shortcomings daily, and had no more mercy for the manifold disabilities of human
[Line 662] nature in general.  In the light of his religion and his learning, he conceived that man should be by many degrees a nobler and a wiser thing than he found him; and this conclusion awoke impatience and a fiery
[Line 663] aversion.  He groped therefore in a blind alley, for as yet service of
[Line 664] man had not brought its revelation to his spirit, or opened the portals of content.  He failed to perceive that the man who lives rationally for men, with all thereby involved in his duty to himself, is
[Line 665] justifying his own existence to the limit of human capacity.  Instead, he fulfilled obligations to his particular God with all his might, and supposed this rule of conduct embraced every necessity.  He
[Line 666] despised his neighbour, but he despised himself also.  Thus he was logical, but such a rule of conduct left him lonely.  Hence it came
[Line 667] about that darkness clothed him like a garment, and that his kind
[Line 668] shunned him, and cared not to consider him.  He sat silent and motionless.  His gift of stillness had often won some little intimate glimpse of Nature, and it did so now.  A fox went by him at close quarters.  It passed absorbed in its own affairs, incautious and without fear.  Then suddenly it saw him, braced its
[Line 669] muscles and slipped away like a streak of cinnamon light through the stones. 
[Line 670] It made for the dwarf oaks beneath the head of the tor, and the watcher
[Line 671] saw its red stern rise and its white-tipped brush jerk this way and
[Line 672] that as it leapt from boulder to boulder.  A big and powerful fox--so Humphrey perceived; one that had doubtless stood before hounds in his
[Line 673] time, and would again.
[Line 674]  Arrived at the confines of the wood, the brute hurried himself no more; but rested awhile and, with a sort of highwayman insolence, surveyed the object of alarm.  Then it disappeared, and the man smiled to
[Line 675] himself and was glad that he had seen this particular neighbour. 
[Line 676] At the poultry-house far below, moved Mrs. Hacker.  Viewed from this
[Line 677] elevation she presented nothing but a sun-bonnet and a great white square of apron.  She wore black, and her bust disappeared seen thus
[Line 678] far away, though her capacious person might be noted at a mile.  Susan
[Line 679] Hacker was florid, taciturn, and staunch to her master.  If she had a hero, it was Mr. Baskerville; and if she had an antipathy, Miss Eliza Gollop stood for that repugnance.  Of Susan it might be said that she was honest and not honest.  In her case, though, she would have scorned to take a crust; she listened at
[Line 680] doors.  To steal a spoon was beyond her power; but to steal information
[Line 681] not intended for her ears did not outrage her moral sense.  Her rare
[Line 682] triumphs were concerned with Humphrey's ragged wardrobe; and when she
[Line 683] could prevail with him to buy a new suit of clothes, or burn an old one, she felt the day had justified itself.
[Line 684]  Now, through the clitters beneath him, there ascended a man, and
[Line 685] Humphrey prepared to meet his nephew.  He had marked Rupert speak with Mrs. Hacker and seen her point to the tor.  It pleased the uncle that this youth should sometimes call unasked upon him, for he rated Rupert as the sanest and usefulest of his kindred.  In a sense Rupert pleased
[Line 686] Humphrey better than his own son did.  A vague instinct to poetry and sentiment and things of abstract beauty, which belonged as an
[Line 687] ingredient to Mark's character, found no echo in his father's breast. 
[Line 688] "I be come to eat my dinner along with you and fetch a message for
[Line 689] Mark," began the young man.  "Mr. Masterman's meeting, to tell everybody about the play, will be held in the parish room early next
[Line 690] month, and parson specially wants you and Mark to be there.  There's an idea of reviving some old-fangled customs.  I dare say 'tis a very good idea, and there will be plenty to lend a hand; but I doubt whether Mark will dress up and spout poetry for him--any more than I would." 
[Line 691] "He means to perform 'St. George' next Christmas and invite the countryside," said Mr. Baskerville.  "Well, one man's meat is another
[Line 692] man's poison.  He's young and energetic.  He'll carry it through somehow with such material as lies about him.  The maidens will all
[Line 693] want to be in it, no doubt."
[Line 694]  "I think 'tis foolery, uncle."  "You think wrong, then.  Ban't always foolery to hark back to old ways. He's got his ideas for waking the people up.  You and me might say,
[Line 695] 'don't wake 'em up'; but 'tisn't our business.  It is his business, as
[Line 696] a minister, to open their eyes and polish their senses.  So let him try
[Line 697] with childish things first--not that he'll succeed, for he won't."
[Line 698]  "Then what's the good of trying?"  "The man must earn his money."
[Line 699]  "Fancy coming to a dead-alive hole like this!  Why, even Jack Head from Trowlesworthy--him as works for Mr. Luscombe--even he laughs at Shaugh." 
[Line 700] "He's a rare Radical, is Head.  'Tis the likes of him the upper people don't want to teach to read or to think--for fear of pickling a rod for themselves.  But Head will be thinking.  He's made so.  I like him."
[Line 701] "He laughed at me for one," said Rupert; "and though I laughed back, I smarted under his tongue.  He says for a young and strapping chap like
[Line 702] me to stop at Cadworthy doing labourer's work for my father, be a poor-spirited and even a shameful thing.  He says I ought to blush to follow a plough or move muck, with the learning I've learnt.  Of course, 'tis a small, mean life, in a manner of speaking, for a man of
[Line 703] energy as loves work like I do." 
[Line 704] Mr. Baskerville scratched his head with the mouthpiece of his pipe, and surveyed Rupert for some time without speaking.
[Line 705]  Then he rose, sniffed the air, and buttoned up his coat.  "We'll walk a bit and I'll show you something," he said.
[Line 706] They set out over Shaugh Moor and Rupert proceeded.
[Line 707]  "I do feel rather down on my luck, somehow--especially about Milly
[Line 708] Luscombe.  It don't seem right or fair exactly--as if Providence wasn't
[Line 709] on my side."
[Line 710] "Don't bleat that nonsensical stuff," said his uncle.  "You're the sort that cry out to Providence if you fall into a bed of nettles--instead
[Line 711] of getting up quick and looking for a dock-leaf.  Time to cry to Providence when you're in a fix you can't get out of single-handed.  If you begin at your time of life, and all about nothing too, belike
[Line 712] 'twill come to be like the cry of 'Wolf, wolf!' and then, when you
[Line 713] really do get into trouble and holloa out, Providence won't heed." 
[Line 714] "Milly Luscombe's not a small thing, anyway.  How can I go on digging and delving while father withstands me and won't hear a word about her?"
[Line 715]  "She's too good for you."
[Line 716]  "I know it; but she don't think so, thank the Lord."  "Your father's a man that moves in a groove.  Maybe you go safer that way; but not further.  The beaten track be his motto.  He married late
[Line 717] in life, and it worked very well; so it follows to his narrow mind that
[Line 718] late in life is the right and only time to marry."  "I wish you'd tell him that you hold with Milly and think a lot of her.
[Line 719] Father has a great opinion of your cleverness, I'm sure." 
[Line 720] "Not he!  'Tis your uncle Nathan that he sets store by.  Quite natural
[Line 721] that he should.  He's a much cleverer man than me, and knows a lot more about human nature.  See how well all folk speak of him.  Can't you get
[Line 722] him your side?  Your father would soon give ear to you if Uncle Nathan approved." 
[Line 723] "'Tis an idea.  And Uncle Nat certainly be kind always.  I might try and get him to do something.  He's very friendly with Mr. Saul
[Line 724] Luscombe, Milly's uncle." 
[Line 725] "How does Luscombe view it?"
[Line 726] "He'll be glad to have Milly off his hands."  "More fool him then.  For there's no more understanding girl about."
[Line 727]  "So Jack Head says.  Ban't often he's got a good word for anybody; but
[Line 728] he's told me, in so many words, that Milly be bang out of the common.
[Line 729] He said it because his savage opinions never fluster her."  They stood on Hawk Tor, and beneath them stretched, first, the carpet of the heath.  Then the ground fell into a valley, where water meadows spread about a stream, and beyond, by woods and homesteads, the earth ascended again to Shaugh Prior.  The village, perched upon the apex of
[Line 730] the hill, twinkled like a jewel.  Glitter of whitewash and rosy-wash
[Line 731] shone under the grey roofs; sunlight and foliage sparkled and intermingled round the church tower; light roamed upon the hills,
[Line 732] revealing and obscuring detail in its passage.  To the far west, above
[Line 733] deep valleys, the world appeared again; but now it had receded and faded and merged in tender blue to the horizon.  Earth spread before
[Line 734] the men in three huge and simple planes: of heath and stone sloping from north to south; of hillside and village and hamlet perched upon
[Line 735] their proper crest; of the dim, dreaming distance swept with the haze of summer and rising to sky-line.
[Line 736]  "That's not small--that's big," said Humphrey Baskerville.  "Plenty of
[Line 737] room here for the best or worse that one boy can do." 
[Line 738] But Rupert doubted.
[Line 739]  "Think of the world out of sight, uncle.  This bit spread here be little more than a picture in its frame."
[Line 740] "Granted; but the frame's wide enough to cage all that your wits will
[Line 741] ever work.  You can run here and wear your fingers to the bone without bruising yourself against any bars.  Go down in the churchyard and take a look at the Baskerville slates--fifty of 'em if there's one: your grandfather, your great-uncle, the musicker, and all the rest.  And every man and woman of the lot lived and died, and suffered and
[Line 742] sweated, and did good or evil within this picture-frame."
[Line 743] "All save the richest--him that went to foreign parts and made a
[Line 744] fortune and sent back tons of money to father and you and Uncle Nat." 
[Line 745] Humphrey laughed. 
[Line 746] "Thou hast me there!" he said.  "But don't be discontented.  Bide a bit
[Line 747] and see how the wind blows.  I'm not against a man following the spirit
[Line 748] that calls him; but wait and find out whether 'tis a true voice or only a lying echo.  What does Milly say?"  "'Tis Milly have put the thought into me, for that matter.  She's terrible large in her opinions.  She holds that father haven't got no
[Line 749] right to refuse to let us be tokened.  She'd come and talk to him, if I'd let her.  A regular fear-nothing, she is."  "What would she have you do?"
[Line 750]  "Gird up and be off.  She comes of a very wandering family, and, of
[Line 751] course, one must allow for that.  I've nought to say against it.  But
[Line 752] they can't bide in one spot long.  Something calls 'em to be roaming." 
[Line 753] "The tribe of Esau."
[Line 754] They talked on, and Rupert found himself the better for some caustic
[Line 755] but sane counsel. 
[Line 756] "'Tis no good asking impossibilities from you, and I'm the last to do
[Line 757] it," said Humphrey.  "There are some things we can't escape from, and
[Line 758] our characters are one of them.  There's no more sense in trying to run
[Line 759] from your character than in trying to run from your shadow.  Too often your character is your shadow, come to think on it; and cruel black at
[Line 760] that.  But don't be impatient.  Wait and watch yourself as well as
[Line 761] other people.  If these thoughts have been put in your head by the
[Line 762] girl, they may not be natural to you, and they may not be digested by you.  See how your own character takes 'em.  I'm not against courting, mind, nor against early marriages; and if this woman be made of the
[Line 763] stuff to mix well and close with your own character, then marry her and
[Line 764] defy the devil and all his angels to harm you.  To take such a woman is
[Line 765] the best day's work that even the hardest working man can do in this world.  But meantime don't whine, but go ahead and gather wisdom and
[Line 766] learn a little about the things that happen outside the
[Line 767] picture-frame--as I do." 
[Line 768] They turned presently and went back to dinner.
[Line 769]  Rupert praised his uncle, and declared that life looked the easier for
[Line 770] his advice.
[Line 771] "'Tis no good being called 'The Hawk' if you can't sharpen your wits as well as your claws," said the old man.  "Yes--you're astonished--but I
[Line 772] know what they call me well enough."
[Line 773] "I knocked a chap down last Sunday on Cadworthy bridge for saying it," declared Rupert.
[Line 774] "Very thoughtful and very proper to stand up for your family; but I'm not hurt.  Maybe there's truth in it.  I've no quarrel with the hawks--or the herons either--for all they do eat the trout.  By all
[Line 775] accounts there was birds to eat trout afore there was men to eat 'em. We humans have invented a saying that possession is nine points of the
[Line 776] law; but we never thought much of that when it comed to knocking our weaker neighbours on the head--whether they be birds or men."  "You've made me a lot more contented with the outlook, anyway."
[Line 777]  "I'm glad to hear it.  Content's the one thing I'd wish you--and wish
[Line 778] myself.  I can't see the way very clear yet.  Let me know if ever you
[Line 779] come by it."
[Line 780] "You!  Why, you'm the most contented of any of us." 
[Line 781] "Come and eat, and don't talk of what you know nought," said Mr. Baskerville.
[Line 782]  They went through the back yard of the homestead presently, where a hot, distinctive odour of pigs saturated the air.  As they passed by, some young, very dirty, pink porkers grunted with fat, amiable voices
[Line 783] and cuddled to their lean mother, where she lay in a lair of ordure.
[Line 784]  "That's content," explained Humphrey; "it belongs to brainless things,
[Line 785] and only to them.  I haven't found it among men and women yet, and I never count to.  Rainbow gold in this world.  Yet, don't mistake me, I'm seeking after it still."
[Line 786] "Why seek for it, if there's no such thing, uncle?" 
[Line 787] "Well may you ask that.  But the answer's easy.  Because 'tis part of my character to seek for it, Rupert.  Character be stronger than reason's self, if you can understand that.  I seek because I'm driven." 
[Line 788] "You might find it after all, uncle.  There must be such a thing--else there'd be no word for it."
[Line 789]  The older sighed.  "A young and hopeful fashion of thought," he said.  "But you're out there.  Men have made up words for many a fine, fancied thing their
[Line 790] hearts long for; but the word is all--stillborn out of poor human hope." 
[Line 791] He brooded deep into his own soul upon this thought and spoke little more that day.  But Mark was waiting for his dinner when they returned, and he and Rupert found themes in common to occupy them through the
[Line 792] meal.
[Line 793] The great project of the new vicar chiefly supplied conversation. Rupert felt indifferent, but Mark was much interested.  "I'm very willing to lend a hand all I can, and I expect the parish
[Line 794] will support it," he said.  "But as for play-acting myself, and taking a part, I wouldn't for all the world.  It beats me how anybody can get up on a platform and speak a speech afore his fellow-creatures
[Line 795] assembled."
[Line 796]  "The girls will like it," foretold Rupert.  "Cora Lintern is to play a part," declared Mark; "and no doubt she'll do it amazing well."
[Line 797] Rupert was up in arms at once.
[Line 798] "I should think they'll ask Milly Luscombe too.  She's got more wits
[Line 799] than any of 'em."
[Line 800] "She may have as much as Cora, but not more, I can assure you of that," answered Mark firmly.  He rarely contradicted a statement or opposed an assertion; but upon this great subject his courage was colossal.   
[Line 801]  CHAPTER VIII 
[Line 802] Mr. Masterman and his sister made more friends than enemies.  The man's
[Line 803] good-nature and energy attracted his parishioners; while Miss Masterman, though not genial, was sincere.  A certain number followed
[Line 804] the party of Mr. Gollop and Eliza, yet, as time passed, it diminished. The surplices arrived; the girls were turned out of the choir; but the heavens did not fall.  Even the Nonconformists of Shaugh Prior regarded
[Line 805] the young vicar with friendliness, and when he called a meeting at the parish room, Mr. Nathan Baskerville and others who stood for dissent,
[Line 806] attended it in an amiable spirit. 
[Line 807] Rumours as to the nature of the proposition had leaked out, and they were vague; but a very general interest had been excited, and when the evening came the vicar, his churchwardens, and friends, found a considerable company assembled.
[Line 808] There were present Vivian and Nathan Baskerville, with most of the former's family.  Mrs. Lintern and her two daughters from Undershaugh
[Line 809] also came; while Heathman Lintern, Ned Baskerville, and other young men
[Line 810] stood in a group at the rear of the company.  From Trowlesworthy
[Line 811] arrived the warrener, Saul Luscombe, his niece, Milly, and his man, Jack Head.  People looked uneasy at sight of the last, for he was a revolutionary and firebrand.  The folk suspected that he held socialistic views, and were certain that he worked harm on the morals of younger people.  Susan Hacker, at her master's wish, attended the meeting and sat impassive among friends.  Thomas Gollop and Joe Voysey, the vicarage gardener, sat together; but Miss Gollop was not present,
[Line 812] because her services were occupied with the newly-born.
[Line 813] A buzz and babel filled the chamber and the heat increased.  Jack Head opened a window.  Whereupon Mr. Gollop rose and shut it again.  The
[Line 814] action typified that eternal battle of principle which waged between them.  But Vivian Baskerville was on the side of fresh air.
[Line 815] "Let be!" he shouted.  "Us don't want to be roasted alive, Thomas!"  So the window was opened once more, and Head triumphed.  Dennis Masterman swiftly explained his desire and invited the parish to
[Line 816] support him in reviving an ancient and obsolete ceremonial.
[Line 817] "The oldest men among you must remember the days of the Christmas
[Line 818] mummers," he said.  "I've heard all about them from eye-witnesses, and
[Line 819] it strikes me that to get up the famous play of 'St. George,' with the quaint old-world dialogue, would give us all something to do this
[Line 820] winter, and be very interesting and instructive, and capital fun.
[Line 821] There are plenty among you who could act the parts splendidly, and as the original version is rather short and barren, I should have some choruses written in, and go through it and polish it up, and perhaps even add a character or two.  In the old days it was all done by the lads, but why not have some lasses in it as well?  However, these are minor points to be decided later.  Would you like the play? that's the first question.  It is a revival of an ancient custom.  It will interest a great many people outside our parish; and if it is to be done at all, it must be done really well.  Probably some will be for it and some against.  For my part, I only want to please the greater number.  Those who are for it had better elect a spokesman, and let him say a word first; then we'll hear those who are against." 
[Line 822] The people listened quietly; then they bent this way and that, and discussed the suggestion.  Some rose and approached Vivian Baskerville,
[Line 823] where he sat beside his brother.  After some minutes of buzzing conversation, during which Vivian shook his head vigorously, and Nathan
[Line 824] as vigorously nodded, the latter rose with reluctance, and the folk
[Line 825] stamped their feet.
[Line 826] "'Tis only because of my brother's modest nature that I get up," he
[Line 827] explained.  "As a Church of England man and a leader among us, they
[Line 828] very properly wanted for him to speak.  But he won't do it, and no more
[Line 829] will young Farmer Waite, and no more will Mr. Luscombe of Trowlesworthy; so I'll voice 'em to the best of my power.  Though I'm
[Line 830] of t'other branch of the Christian Church, yet my friends will bear me out that I've nothing but kind feeling and regard for all of them, and in such a pleasant matter as this I shall do all in my power to help
[Line 831] your reverence, as we all shall.  For I do think there's none but will make the mummers welcome again, and lend a hand to lift the fun into a
[Line 832] great success.  Me and my brother and Luscombe, and Waite and Gollop,
[Line 833] and Joe Voysey, and a good few more, can well remember the old mumming
[Line 834] days; and we'll all do our best to rub up our memories.  So what we all say is, 'Go ahead, Mr. Masterman, and good luck to it!'"
[Line 835]  Applause greeted Nathan.  The folk were filled with admiration at his
[Line 836] ready turn of speech.  He sat down again between Mrs. Lintern and Cora. Everybody clapped their hands.  Then came a hiss from the corner where Jack Head stood. 
[Line 837] "A dissentient voice," declared the clergyman.  "Who is that?"
[Line 838]  "My name is Jack Head, and I be gwaine to offer objections," said the
[Line 839] man stoutly. 
[Line 840] "Better save your wind then!" snapped Mr. Gollop.  "You be one against
[Line 841] the meeting."  Head was a middle-aged, narrow-browed, and underhung individual of an
[Line 842] iron-grey colour.  His body was long and thin; his shoulders were high;
[Line 843] his expression aggressive, yet humorous.  He had swift wits and a
[Line 844] narrow understanding.  He was observant and impressed with the misery
[Line 845] of the world; but he possessed no philosophical formulas to balance his observation or counsel patience before the welter of life.  He was
[Line 846] honest, but scarce knew the meaning of amenity. 
[Line 847] "One or not won't shut my mouth," he said.  "I'm a member of the parish so much as you, though I don't bleat a lot of wild nonsense come every
[Line 848] seventh day, and I say that to spend good time and waste good money
[Line 849] this way be a disgrace, and a going back instead of going forward. What for do we want to stir up a lot of silly dead foolishness that our grandfathers invented?  Ban't there nothing better to do with ourselves and our wits than dress up like a ship-load of monkeys and go
[Line 850] play-acting?  We might so well start to wassail the apple-trees and put
[Line 851] mourning on the bee-butts when a man dies.  I'm against it, and I
[Line 852] propose instead that Mr. Masterman looks round him and sees what a miserable Jakes of a mess his parish be in, and spends his time trying to get the landlords to----"  "Order!  Order!  Withdraw that!" cried out Mr. Gollop furiously.  "How
[Line 853] dare this infidel man up and say the parish be in a Jakes of a mess?
[Line 854] Where's Ben North?" 
[Line 855] "I'm here, Thomas," said a policeman, who stood at the door. 
[Line 856] "You'm a silly old mumphead," replied Jack.  "To hear you about this parish--God's truth!  I'll tell you this, my brave hero.  When the devil was showing the Lord the kingdoms of the earth and the glory of
[Line 857] 'em, he kept his thumb on Shaugh Prior, so as none should see what a
[Line 858] dung-heap of a place it was."  "Order!  Order!" cried Miss Masterman shrilly, and Mr. Gollop grew livid.  "I appeal to the chair!  I appeal to the nation!" he gasped.  Then he shook his fist at Jack.
[Line 859]  "There's no chair--not yet," explained Dennis.  "As soon as we decide, I'll take the chair, and we'll appoint a committee to go into the matter and arrange the parts, and so on.  The first thing is, are we
[Line 860] agreed?" 
[Line 861] One loud shout attested to the sense of the meeting.
[Line 862]  "Then, Mr. Head, you're in a minority of one, and I hope we may yet
[Line 863] convince you that this innocent revival is not a bad thing," said Dennis.  "And further than that, you mustn't run down Shaugh Prior in this company.  We've got a cheerful conceit of ourselves, and why not?
[Line 864] Don't think I'm dead to the dark side of human life, and the sorrows
[Line 865] and sufferings of the poor.  I hope you'll all very soon find that I'm
[Line 866] not that sort, or my sister either.  And the devil himself can't hide
[Line 867] Shaugh Prior from the Lord and Saviour of us all, Mr. Head--have no fear of that."
[Line 868] "Sit down, Jack, and say you'm sorry," cried Mr. Luscombe. 
[Line 869] "Not me," replied Head.  "I've stated my views at a free meeting, and I'm on the losing side, like men of my opinions always be where parsons
[Line 870] have a voice.  But me and my friends will be up top presently."  "Turn him out, Ben North!" shouted Mr. Gollop; but Ben North refused. Indeed, he was of Jack's party.
[Line 871] "He've done nought but say his say, and I shan't turn him out," the policeman answered.  "There's nobody in the chair yet, and therefore there's none here with power to command the Law to move."  A committee was swiftly formed.  It consisted of the clergyman and certain parishioners.  Nathan joined it for his family; Mr. Luscombe
[Line 872] also joined, and Dennis promised that certain local antiquaries and the lord of the manor would assist the enterprise.
[Line 873] "While we are here," he said, "we may as well get the thing well
[Line 874] advanced and decide about the characters.  All those interested are
[Line 875] here, so why not let me read through the old play as it stands?  Then we'll settle the parts, and each can copy his or her part in turn."
[Line 876]  "There's nothing like being fore-handed," admitted Nathan.  "Let's have it by all means.  We shall want young and old to play, if my memory
[Line 877] serves me."  "We shall, and a good company to sing the songs that I hope to add.  My
[Line 878] sister, our organist, will undertake the music."
[Line 879]  "And right well she'll do it, without a doubt," declared Nathan.  "On all hands 'tis admitted how the church music has mended a lot since she took it up." 
[Line 880] Mr. Masterman then read a version of the old play, and its ingenuous humour woke laughter. 
[Line 881] "Now," said the vicar when his recital was at an end, "I'll ask those
[Line 882] among us who will volunteer to act--ladies and gentlemen--to come forward.  Especially I appeal to the ladies.  They'll have to say very little."
[Line 883]  "Only to look nice, and I'm sure that won't cost 'em an effort, for they can't help it," declared Nathan.
[Line 884]  None immediately rose.  Then Ned Baskerville strolled down the room.
[Line 885] "Best-looking young man in Shaugh," cried an anonymous voice.
[Line 886] "And the laziest!" answered another unknown.  There was a laugh and Ned turned ruddy.
[Line 887] "Thou'lt never take trouble enough to learn thy part, Ned!" cried
[Line 888] Heathman Lintern.
[Line 889] "Play Turkish knight, my son," said his father.  "Then thou can'st be
[Line 890] knocked on the head and die comfortable without more trouble."  Others followed Ned, and Mr. Masterman called for Mark.
[Line 891]  "You'll not desert us, Mark?  I shall want your help, I know."
[Line 892]  "And glad to give it," answered the young man.  He grew very hot and nervous to find himself named.  His voice broke, he coughed and cut a
[Line 893] poor figure.  Somebody patted him on the back.  "Don't be frighted, Mark," said Vivian Baskerville; "his reverence only
[Line 894] wants for you to do what you can.  He wouldn't ask impossibilities." 
[Line 895] Mrs. Baskerville compared her handsome son to stammering Mark and felt
[Line 896] satisfied.  Cora Lintern also contrasted the young men, and in her
[Line 897] bosom was anything but satisfaction. 
[Line 898] "You needn't act, but you must help in many ways.  You're so well up in the old lore--all about our legends and customs," explained the clergyman.  "We count on you.  And now we want some of the older men among you, and when we've settled them we must come to the ladies. We're getting on splendidly.  Now--come--you set a good example, Thomas."  "Me!" cried Mr. Gollop.  "Me to play-act!  Whoever heard the like?" 
[Line 899] "You must play, Thomas," urged Vivian Baskerville of Cadworthy.  "Such a voice can't be lost.  What a King of Egypt the man will make!"  "I'll do a part if you will, but not else," returned Gollop, and the
[Line 900] Baskerville family lifted a laugh at their father's expense. 
[Line 901] "For that matter I've took the stage often enough," admitted Vivian; "but 'twas to work, not to talk.  All the same, if his reverence would
[Line 902] like for me to play a part, why, I'm ready and willing, so long as
[Line 903] there isn't much to say to it." 
[Line 904] "Hurrah for Mr. Baskerville!" shouted several present.  "And Mr. Nathan must play, too," declared Joe Voysey.  "No revel would be complete without him."  "If you'll listen I'll tell you what I think," said the clergyman.
[Line 905] "I've considered your parts during the last five minutes, and they go
[Line 906] like this in my mind.  Let's take them in order:--
[Line 907]  "St. George, Mr. Ned Baskerville.  Will you do St. George, Ned?" 
[Line 908] "Yes, if you can't find a better," said the young man.  "Good!  Now the Turkish knight comes next.  He must be young and a bit
[Line 909] of a fighter.  Will you be Turkish knight, Mr. Waite?"  He addressed a young, good-looking, dark man, who farmed land in the
[Line 910] parish, and dwelt a few miles off.
[Line 911] Mr. Waite laughed and nodded. 
[Line 912] "Right--I'll try." 
[Line 913] "Well done!  Now"--Mr. Masterman smiled and looked at Jack Head--"will
[Line 914] Mr. Head play the Bear--to oblige us all?"
[Line 915] Everybody laughed, including Jack himself. 
[Line 916] "The very living man for Bear!" cried Mr. Luscombe.  "I command you, Jack, to be Bear!"
[Line 917] "You ain't got much to do but growl and fight, Jack, and you're a oner
[Line 918] at both," said Heathman.
[Line 919]  "Well, I've said my say," returned Mr. Head, "and I was in a minority. But since this parish wants for me to be Bear, I'll Bear it out so well as I can; and if I give St. George a bit of a hug afore he bowls me
[Line 920] over, he mustn't mind that."
[Line 921] "Capital!  Thank you, Jack Head.  Now, who'll be Father Christmas?  I
[Line 922] vote for Mr. Nathan Baskerville."
[Line 923] Applause greeted the suggestion, but Miss Masterman bent over from her
[Line 924] seat and whispered to her brother.  He shook his head, however, and answered under his breath. 
[Line 925] "It doesn't matter a button about his being a dissenter.  So much the
[Line 926] better.  Let's draw them in all we can." 
[Line 927] "You ought to choose the church people first."
[Line 928]  "It's done now, anyway," he replied.  "Everybody likes the man.  We must have him in it, or half the folk won't come." 
[Line 929] "The King of Egypt is next," said Nathan, after he had been duly elected to Father Christmas.  "I say Thomas Gollop here for the part."
[Line 930]  "I don't play nought," answered Thomas firmly, "unless Vivian Baskerville do.  He's promised."
[Line 931]  "I'll be Giant, then, and say 'Fee-fo-fum!" answered the farmer. "'Twill be a terrible come-along-of-it for Ned here, and I warn him that if he don't fight properly valiant, I won't die."
[Line 932]  "The very man--the only man for Giant," declared Dennis Masterman.  "So that's settled.  Now, who's for Doctor?  That's a very important part. I suppose your father wouldn't do it, Mark?  He's just the wise-looking face for a doctor."
[Line 933]  "My brother!" cried Vivian.  "Good Lord!  he'd so soon stand on his
[Line 934] head in the market-place as lend a hand in a bit of nonsense like this.
[Line 935] Ask Luscombe here.  Will you be Doctor, Saul?" 
[Line 936] But Mr. Luscombe refused.  "Not in my line.  Here's Joe Voysey--he's doctored a lot of things in
[Line 937] his time--haven't you, Joe?" 
[Line 938] "Will you be Doctor, Joe?" asked Mr. Masterman.  But Joe refused.  "Too much to say," he answered.  "I might larn it with a bit of sweat,
[Line 939] but I should never call it home when the time came."
[Line 940]  "Be the French Eagle, Joe," suggested Mark Baskerville.  "You've got but little to say, and St. George soon settles you."
[Line 941]  "And the very living nose for it, Joe," urged Mr. Gollop.
[Line 942]  "Very well, if the meeting is for it, I'll be Eagle," assented Mr.
[Line 943] Voysey. 
[Line 944] The part of Doctor remained unfilled for the present.
[Line 945]  "Now there's the fair Princess Sabra and Mother Dorothy," explained the
[Line 946] vicar.  "Princess Sabra, the King of Egypt's daughter, will be a novelty, for she didn't come into the old play in person.  She doesn't
[Line 947] say anything, but she must be there."
[Line 948]  "Miss Lintern for Princess Sabra!" said Mark.
[Line 949] Everybody laughed, and the young man came in for some chaff; but Dennis
[Line 950] approved, and Mrs. Lintern nodded and smiled.  Cora blushed and Nathan
[Line 951] patted Mark on the back.
[Line 952]  "A good idea, and we're all for it," he said. 
[Line 953] To Cora, as the belle of the village, belonged the part by right.  She
[Line 954] was surprised and gratified at this sudden access of importance.
[Line 955]  Then the vicar prepared to close his meeting.
[Line 956] "For Mother Dorothy we want a lady of mature years and experience.  The
[Line 957] part is often played by a man, but I would sooner a lady played it, if we can persuade one to do so," he said.
[Line 958]  "Mrs. Hacker!  Mrs. Hacker!" shouted a mischievous young man at the
[Line 959] back of the hall.  "Never," said Susan Hacker calmly.  "Not that I'd mind; but whatever would my master say?" 
[Line 960] "Let my sister play the part," suggested Thomas.  "Eliza Gollop fears
[Line 961] nought on two legs.  She'll go bravely through with it." 
[Line 962] Mr. Nathan's heart sank, but he could not object.  The company was divided.  Then, to the surprise of not a few, Mrs. Hacker spoke again.  The hated name had dispelled her doubts. 
[Line 963] "I'll do it, and chance master," she said.  "Yes, there's no false shame in me, I believe.  I'll do it rather than----" 
[Line 964] "You're made for the part, ma'am," declared Mr. Nathan, much relieved. "And very fine you'll look.  You've got to kiss Father Christmas at the end of the play, though.  I hope you don't mind that."
[Line 965]  "That's why she's going to act the part!" shouted Heathman, and laughter drowned Mrs. Hacker's reply.  In good spirits the company broke up, and the young folk went away
[Line 966] excited, the old people interested and amused.
[Line 967] Merriment sounded on the grey July night; many women chattered about the play till long after their usual hour for sleep; and plenty of
[Line 968] coarse jests as to the promised entertainment were uttered at the bar
[Line 969] of 'The White Thorn' presently.  As for the vicar and his sister, they felt that they had achieved a triumph.  Two shadows alone darkened the outlook in Miss Masterman's
[Line 970] eyes.  She objected to the Nonconformist element as undesirable or unnecessary; and she did not like the introduction of Queen Sabra.
[Line 971]  "That showy girl is quite conceited enough already," she said.  But her brother was young and warm-hearted.  "She's lovely, though," he said.  "By Jove! the play will be worth
[Line 972] doing, if only to see her got up like a princess!"  "Don't be silly, Dennis," answered his sister.  "She's a rude wretch,
[Line 973] and the Linterns are the most independent people in the parish."     CHAPTER IX  At high summer two men and two maids kept public holiday and wove romance under the great crown of Pen Beacon.  From this border height
[Line 974] the South Hams spread in a mighty vision of rounded hills and plains; whole forests were reduced to squat, green cushions laid upon the broad earth's bosom; and amid them glimmered wedges and squares of ripening
[Line 975] corn, shone root crops, smiled water meadows, and spread the emerald
[Line 976] faces of shorn hayfields.  It was a day of lowering clouds and illumination breaking through them.
[Line 977] Fans of light fell between the piled-up cumuli, and the earth was
[Line 978] mottled with immense, alternate patches of shadow and sunshine.  Thick
[Line 979] and visible strata of air hung heavy between earth and sky at this early hour.  They presaged doubt, and comprehended a condition that might presently diffuse and lift into unclouded glory of August light, or darken to thunderstorm.  Southerly the nakedness of Hanger Down and
[Line 980] the crags of Eastern and Western Beacons towered; while to the east
[Line 981] were Quickbeam Hill, Three Barrows, and the featureless expanses of Stall Moor.  Northerly towered Penshiel, and the waste spread beyond it
[Line 982] in long leagues, whose planes were flattened out by distance and
[Line 983] distinguished against each other by sleeping darkness and waking light. 
[Line 984] A fuliginous heaviness, that stained air at earth's surface, persisted even on this lofty ground, and the highest passages of aerial radiance were not about the sun, but far beneath it upon the horizon.
[Line 985]  Rupert Baskerville trudged doubtfully forward, sniffing the air and
[Line 986] watching the sky, while beside him came Milly Luscombe; and a quarter
[Line 987] of a mile behind them walked Mark and Cora Lintern.  The men had
[Line 988] arranged to spend their holiday up aloft, and Milly was well pleased; but Cora held the expedition vain save for what it should accomplish. To dawdle in the Moor when she might have been at a holiday revel was not her idea of pleasure; but as soon as Mark issued his invitation she guessed that he did so with an object, and promised to join him.
[Line 989]  As yet the definite word had not passed his lips, though it had hovered
[Line 990] there; but to-day Miss Lintern was resolved to return from Pen Beacon betrothed.  As for Mark, his hope chimed with her intention.  Cora was
[Line 991] always gracious and free of her time, while he played the devout lover and sincerely held her above him every way.  Only the week before Heathman, obviously inspired to do so, had asked him why he kept off,
[Line 992] and declared that it would better become him to speak.  And now, feeling that the meal presently to be taken would be of a more joyous
[Line 993] character after than before the deed, he stopped Cora while yet a mile remained to trudge before they should reach the top of the tor.  "Rest a bit," he said.  "Let Rupert and Milly go forward.  They don't want us, and we shall all meet in the old roundy-poundies up over, where we're going to eat our dinner." 
[Line 994] "Looks as if 'twas offering for bad weather," she answered, lifting her
[Line 995] eyes to the sky.  "I'm glad I didn't put on my new muslin." 
[Line 996] She sat on a stone and felt that he was now going to ask her to marry him.  She was not enthusiastic about him at the bottom of her heart;
[Line 997] but she knew that he would be rich and a good match for a girl in her position.  She was prone to exaggerate her beauty, and had hoped better
[Line 998] things from it than Mark Baskerville; but certain minor romances with more important men had come to nothing.  She was practical and made herself see the bright side of the contract.  He was humble and she
[Line 999] could influence him as she pleased.  He worshipped her and would doubtless continue to do so.
[Line 1000]  Once his wife she proposed to waken in him a better conceit of himself
[Line 1001] and, when his father died, she would be able to 'blossom out,' as she put it to her sister, and hold her head high in the land.  There were prospects.  Nathan Baskerville was rich also, and he was childless.  He liked Mark well, and on one occasion, when she came into the farm
[Line 1002] kitchen at Undershaugh suddenly, she overheard Nathan say to her mother, "No objection--none at all--a capital match for her."
[Line 1003] Mark put down the basket that carried their meal and took a seat beside Cora.
[Line 1004] "'Tisn't going to rain," he said.  "I always know by my head if there's thunder in the elements.  It gets a sort of heavy, aching feeling.
[Line 1005] Look yonder, the clouds are levelling off above the Moor so true as if they'd been planed.  That's the wind's work.  Why, there's enough blue showing to make you a new dress a'ready, Cora."
[Line 1006]  "I'd love a dress of such blue as that.  Blue's my colour," she said.
[Line 1007]  "Yes, it is--though you look lovely enough in any colour."
[Line 1008] "I like to please you, Mark."
[Line 1009] "Oh, Cora, and don't you please me?  Little you know--little you know. I've had it on my tongue a thousand times--yet it seems too bold--from such as me to you.  Why, there's none you mightn't look to; and if
[Line 1010] you'd come of a higher havage, you'd have been among the loveliest ladies in the land.  And so you are now, for that matter--only you're
[Line 1011] hid away in this savage old place--like a beautiful pearl under the wild sea." 
[Line 1012] This had long been Cora's own opinion.  She smiled and touched the hair on her hot forehead.  "If there comes on a fog, I shall go out of curl in a minute," she
[Line 1013] said.  Then, seeing that this prophecy silenced him, she spoke again.  "I love to hear you tell these kind things, Mark.  I'd sooner please you than any man living.  Perhaps 'tis over-bold in me to say so; but
[Line 1014] I'm telling nought but truth." 
[Line 1015] "Truth ban't often so beautiful as that," he said slowly.  "And 'tis like your brave heart to say it out; and here's truth for your truth,
[Line 1016] Cora.  If you care to hear me say I think well of you, then I care to
[Line 1017] hear you speak well of me; and more: nobody else's good word is better than wind in the trees against your slightest whisper.  So that I
[Line 1018] please you, I care nothing for all the world; and if you'll let me,
[Line 1019] I'll live for you and die for you.  For that matter I've lived for only
[Line 1020] you these many days, and if you'll marry me--there--'tis out.  I'm a vain chap even to dare to say it; but 'tis you have made me so--'tis
[Line 1021] your kind words and thoughts for me--little thoughts that peep out and
[Line 1022] dear little kind things done by you and forgotten by you; but never by
[Line 1023] me, Cora.  Can you do it?  Can you sink down to me, or is it too much
[Line 1024] of a drop?  Others have lowered themselves for love and never regretted it.  'Tis a fall for such a bright, lovely star as you; but my love's ready to catch you, so you shan't hurt yourself.  I--I----"
[Line 1025] He broke off and she seemed really moved.  She put her hand on his two, which were knotted together; and then she looked love into his
[Line 1026] straining eyes and nodded.
[Line 1027]  His hands opened and seized hers and squeezed them till she drew in her breath.  Then he put his arms round her and kissed her.
[Line 1028] "Don't move, for God's sake!" he said.  "D'you know what you've done?"
[Line 1029] "Given myself to a dear good chap," she answered.
[Line 1030]  In her heart she was thanking heaven that she had not worn the new
[Line 1031] muslin dress.
[Line 1032] "Weather or no weather, he'd have creased it and mangled it all over
[Line 1033] and ruined it for ever," she thought.
[Line 1034]  They proceeded presently, but made no haste to overtake their companions.  Their talk was of the future and marriage.  He pressed for
[Line 1035] an early union; she was in no hurry. 
[Line 1036] "You must learn a bit more about me first," she told him.  "Maybe I'm not half as nice as you think.  And there's your father.  I'm terrible
[Line 1037] frightened of him."  "You need not be, Cora.  He's not against early marriage.  You must come and see him pretty soon.  He'll be right glad for my sake, though he'll be sure to tell me I've had better luck than I deserve."
[Line 1038]  She considered awhile without speaking. 
[Line 1039] "I'm afraid I shan't bring you much money," she said.  "What's money?  That's the least thing.  I shall have plenty enough, no doubt."
[Line 1040] "What will your father do?  Then there's your uncle, Mr. Nathan.  He's
[Line 1041] terrible rich, by all accounts, and he thinks very well of you." 
[Line 1042] "I shall be all right.  But I'm a lazy man--too lazy.  I shall turn my
[Line 1043] hand to something steady when we're married." 
[Line 1044] "Such a dreamer you are.  Not but what, with all your great cleverness,
[Line 1045] you ban't worth all the young men put together for brains."
[Line 1046]  "I'm going to set to.  My father's often at me about wasting my life.
[Line 1047] But, though he'd scorn the word, he's a bit of a dreamer too--in his
[Line 1048] way.  You'd never guess it; but he spends many long hours all alone,
[Line 1049] brooding about things.  And he's a very sharp-eyed, clever man.  He
[Line 1050] marks the seasons by the things that happen out of doors.  He'll come
[Line 1051] down off our tor that cheerful sometimes, you wouldn't believe 'twas
[Line 1052] him.  'Curlew's back on the Moor,' he'll say one day; then another day, 'Oaks are budding'; then again, 'First frost to-night,' or 'Thunder's coming.'  His bark is worse than his bite, really."
[Line 1053]  "'Tis his terrible eyes I fear.  They look through you.  He makes me feel small, and I always hate anybody that does that."  "You mustn't hate him.  Too many do already.  But 'twould be better to
[Line 1054] feel sorry for him.  He's often a very unhappy old man.  I feel it, but
[Line 1055] I can't see the reason, and he says nothing."  She pouted. 
[Line 1056] "I wish I hadn't got to see him.  Why, his own brother--your Uncle Nathan--even he can't hit it off with him.  And I'm sure there must be
[Line 1057] something wrong with a man that can't get on with Mr. Nathan. Everybody is fond of him; but I've often heard him say----"
[Line 1058]  "Leave it," interrupted Mark.  "I know all that, Cora.  'Tis just one of those puzzles that happen.  'Tis no good fretting about anybody
[Line 1059] else: what you've got to do is to make my father love you.  And you've only got to be yourself and he must love you."
[Line 1060] "Of course I'll do my best."
[Line 1061] "Give me just one more lovely kiss, before we get over the hill-top and come in sight of them.  We're to meet at the 'old men's' camp."  She kissed him and then silence fell between them.  It lasted a long while until he broke it.
[Line 1062] "Don't fancy because I'm so still that I'm not bursting with joy," he said.  "But when I think of what's happened to me this minute, I feel 'tis too big for words.  The thoughts in me can't be spoken, Cora. They are too large to cram into little pitiful speeches."
[Line 1063] "I'm getting hungry; and there's Milly waving," she answered.  "Milly's hungry too, belike."  Eastward, under Pen Beacon, lay an ancient lodge of the neolithic people.  The circles of scattered granite shone grey, set in foliage
[Line 1064] and fruit of the bilberry, with lichens on the stone and mosses woven
[Line 1065] into the grass about them.  A semicircle of hills extended beyond and
[Line 1066] formed a mighty theatre where dawn and storm played their parts, where falling night was pictured largely and moonshine slept upon lonely heights and valleys.  In the glen beneath spread Dendles Wood, with fringes of larch and pine hiding the River Yealm and spreading a
[Line 1067] verdant medley of deep summer green in the lap of the grey hills.  Gold
[Line 1068] autumn furzes flashed along the waste, and the pink ling broke into her first tremble of colourless light that precedes the blush of fulness. 
[Line 1069] The party of four sat in a hut circle and spoke little while they ate and drank.  Rupert, unknown to the rest, and much to his own inconvenience, had dragged up six stone bottles of ginger-beer hidden
[Line 1070] under his coat.  These he produced and was much applauded.  A spring
[Line 1071] broke at hand, and the bottles were sunk therein to cool them.
[Line 1072]  They talked together after a very practical and businesslike fashion. Milly and Rupert were definitely engaged in their own opinion, and now
[Line 1073] when Mark, who could not keep in the stupendous event of the moment, announced it, they congratulated the newly engaged couple with the wisdom and experience of those who had long entered that state.
[Line 1074]  "'Tis a devilish unrestful condition, I can promise you," said Rupert,
[Line 1075] "and the man always finds it so if the girl don't.  Hanging on is just
[Line 1076] hell--especially in my case, where I can't get father to see with my eyes.  But, thank God, Milly's jonic.  She won't change."
[Line 1077] "No," said Milly, "I shan't change.  'Tis you have got to change.  I
[Line 1078] respect your father very much, like the rest of the world, but because he didn't marry till he was turned forty-five, that's no reason why you
[Line 1079] should wait twenty years for it.  Anyway, if you must, so will I--only
[Line 1080] I shall be a thought elderly for the business by that time.  However,
[Line 1081] it rests with you."
[Line 1082]  "I'm going--that's what she means," explained Rupert.  "Jack Head and
[Line 1083] me have had a talk, and he's thrown a lot of light on things in
[Line 1084] general.  I can't be bound hand and foot to my father like this; and if
[Line 1085] he won't meet me, I must take things into my own hands and leave home."
[Line 1086]  Mark was staggered at the enormity of such a plan.  "Don't do anything in a hurry and without due thought."  "Very well for you to talk," said Milly.  "You do nought but ring the
[Line 1087] bells on Sundays, and play at work the rest of the week.  Mr. Humphrey
[Line 1088] won't stand in your way.  I suppose you could be married afore Christmas, if you pleased."  She sighed at the glorious possibility. 
[Line 1089] "I hope we shall be; but Cora's in no hurry, I'm afraid."
[Line 1090] "And when I've got work," continued Rupert, "then I shall just look
[Line 1091] round and take a house and marry; and why not?" 
[Line 1092] "Your father will never let you go.  It isn't to be thought upon," declared Mark.
[Line 1093] "Then he must be reasonable.  He appears to forget I'm nearly twenty-four," answered his cousin. 
[Line 1094] Conversation ranged over their problems and their hopes.  Then Rupert touched another matrimonial disappointment. 
[Line 1095] "It looks as if we were not to be fortunate in love," he said. "There's Ned terrible down on his luck.  He's offered marriage again--to Farmer Chave's second daughter; and 'twas as good as done;
[Line 1096] but Mr. Chave wouldn't hear of it, and he's talked the girl round and
[Line 1097] Ned's got chucked."
[Line 1098] "Serve him right," said Milly.  "He jilted two girls.  'Twill do him good to smart a bit himself." 
[Line 1099] "The Chaves are a lot too high for us," asserted Mark.  "He's a very
[Line 1100] well-born and rich man, and his father was a Justice of the Peace, and
[Line 1101] known in London.  He only farms to amuse himself."
[Line 1102]  "'Twas Ned's face, I reckon," said Cora.  "They Chave women are both
[Line 1103] terrible stuck up.  Makes me sick to see 'em in church all in their
[Line 1104] town-made clothes.  But fine feathers won't make fine birds of them. They'm both flat as a plate, and a lot older than they pretend.  Ned is
[Line 1105] well out of it, I reckon." 
[Line 1106] "He don't think so, however," replied Rupert.  "I've never known him take any of his affairs to heart like this one.  Moped and gallied he is, and creeps about with a face as long as a fiddle; and off his food too." 
[Line 1107] "Poor chap," said Cora feelingly.  "Even talks of ending it and making away with himself.  Terrible hard hit, I do believe."
[Line 1108]  "Your mother must be in a bad way about him," said Milly.
[Line 1109] "She is.  Why, he took mother down to the river last Sunday and showed her a big hole there, where Plym comes over the rocks and the waters all a-boil and twelve feet deep.  'That's where you'll find me, mother,' he says.  And she, poor soul, was frightened out of her wits.
[Line 1110] And father's worried too, for Ned can't go wrong with him.  Ned may always do what he likes, though I may not."
[Line 1111] Cora declared her sympathy, but Mark did not take the incident as grave.
[Line 1112]  "You needn't fear," he assured Ned's brother.  "Men that talk openly of
[Line 1113] killing themselves, never do it.  Words are a safety-valve.  'Tis the sort that go silent and cheerful under a great blow that be nearest death."
[Line 1114]  Cora spoke of Ned's looks with admiration and feared that this great disappointment might spoil them; but Milly was not so sympathetic. 
[Line 1115] "If he stood to work and didn't think so much about the maidens, they
[Line 1116] might think a bit more about him," she said.  "He swears he won't play St. George now," added Rupert.  "He haven't got the heart to go play-acting no more." 
[Line 1117] "He'll find twenty girls to go philandering after afore winter," foretold Milly.  "And if Cora here was to ask him, he'd play St. George
[Line 1118] fast enough." 
[Line 1119] "'Twill be a very poor compliment to me if he cries off now," declared
[Line 1120] Cora.  "For I'm to be the princess, and 'tis pretended in the play that
[Line 1121] he's my true lover."  "Mark will be jealous then.  'Tis a pity he don't play St. George," said Milly.
[Line 1122]  But Mark laughed.
[Line 1123]  "A pretty St. George me!" he answered.  "No, no; I'm not jealous of
[Line 1124] Ned.  Safety in numbers, they say.  Let him be St. George and welcome;
[Line 1125] and very noble he'll look--if ever he's got brains enough in his empty noddle to get the words and remember them."  Cora cast a swift side glance at her betrothed.  She did not speak, but the look was not all love.  Discontent haunted her for a little space. 
[Line 1126] The ginger-beer was drunk and the repast finished.  The men lighted
[Line 1127] their pipes; the girls talked together.
[Line 1128] Milly congratulated Cora very heartily.
[Line 1129]  "He's a fine, witty chap, as I've always said.  Different to most of us, along of being better eggicated.  But that modest and retiring, few people know what a clever man he is."  These things pleased the other, and she was still more pleased when
[Line 1130] Milly discussed Mark's father.
[Line 1131] "I often see him," she said--"oftener than you might think for.  He'll
[Line 1132] ride to Trowlesworthy twice and thrice a month sometimes.  Why for?  To
[Line 1133] see my uncle, you might fancy.  But that's not the reason.  To talk with Jack he comes.  Jack Head and me be the only people in these parts that ban't afraid of him.  And that's what he likes.  You be fearless
[Line 1134] of him, Cora, or he'll think nought of thee.  Fearless and attentive to
[Line 1135] what he says--that's the rule with him.  And pretend nothing, or he'll
[Line 1136] see through it and pull you to pieces.  Him and Jack Head says the most
[Line 1137] tremendous things about the world and its ways.  They take Uncle Saul's breath away sometimes, and mine too.  But don't let him frighten
[Line 1138] you--that's the fatal thing.  If a creature's feared of him, he
[Line 1139] despises it.  Never look surprised at his speeches." 
[Line 1140] Cora listened to this advice and thanked the other girl for it.  "Why should I care a button for the old man, anyway?" she asked.  "If it comes to that, I'm as good as him.  There's nought to fear really, when all's said.  And I won't fear." 
[Line 1141] The men strolled about the old village and gathered whortleberries; then Rupert judged that the storm that had skulked so long to the
[Line 1142] north, was coming at last. 
[Line 1143] "We'd best be getting down-along," he said.  "Let's go across to Trowlesworthy; then, if it breaks, we can slip into the warren house a bit till the worst be over.
[Line 1144]  "You be all coming to drink tea there," said Milly.  "Uncle Saul and
[Line 1145] Jack Head are away, but aunt be home, and I made the cakes specially o'
[Line 1146] Saturday."
[Line 1147] Drifting apart by a half a mile or so, the young couples left the
[Line 1148] Beacon, climbed Penshiel, and thence passed over the waste to where the
[Line 1149] red tor rose above Milly Luscombe's home.  A sort of twilight stole at four o'clock over the earth, and it seemed that night hastened up while yet the hidden sun was high.  The sinister
[Line 1150] sky darkened and frowned to bursting; yet no rain fell, and later it grew light again, as the sun, sinking beneath the ridges of the clouds, flooded the Moor with the greatest brightness that the day had known. 
[Line 1151]  
[Line 1152] CHAPTER X
[Line 1153]  Some few weeks after it was known that young Mark Baskerville would marry Cora Lintern, a small company drank beer at 'The White Thorn' and
[Line 1154] discussed local politics in general, and the engagement in particular.
[Line 1155] The time was three in the afternoon.
[Line 1156]  "They'll look to you for a wedding present without a doubt," said Mr. Gollop to Nathan, who stood behind his bar. 
[Line 1157] "And they'll be right," answered the innkeeper.  "I'm very fond of 'em both." 
[Line 1158] "You'll be put to it to find rich gifts for all your young people,
[Line 1159] however."
[Line 1160]  "That's as may be.  If the Lord don't send you sons, the Devil will
[Line 1161] send you nephews--you know the old saying.  Not but what Vivian's boys
[Line 1162] and girls are a very nice lot--I like 'em all very well indeed.  Mark's
[Line 1163] different--clever enough, but made of another clay.  His mother was a
[Line 1164] retiring, humble woman--frightened of her own shadow, you might say.
[Line 1165] However, Cora will wake him into a cheerfuller conceit of himself."  There was an interruption, for Dennis Masterman suddenly filled the
[Line 1166] doorway. 
[Line 1167] "The very men I want," he said; then he entered. 
[Line 1168] "Fine sweltering weather for the harvest, your honour," piped an old
[Line 1169] fellow who sat on a settle by the window with a mug of beer beside him.  "So it is, Abel, and I hope there's another month of it to come.  Give me half a pint of the mild, will you, Baskerville?  'Tis about the rehearsal I've looked in.  Thursday week is the day--at seven o'clock
[Line 1170] sharp, remember.  And I'm very anxious that everybody shall know their
[Line 1171] words.  It will save a lot of trouble and help us on."  "I've got mine very near," said Nathan.
[Line 1172] "So have I," declared Mr. Gollop.  "Here I, the King of Egypt, boldly
[Line 1173] do appear; St. Garge, St. Garge, walk in, my only son and heir!"
[Line 1174]  "Yes, but you mustn't say '_h_eir'; the h isn't sounded, you know.  Has anybody seen Ned Baskerville?  I heard that he was in trouble."
[Line 1175]  "Not at all," said Nathan.  "He's all right--a lazy rascal.  'Twas only another of his silly bits of work with the girls.  Running after Mr. Chave's daughter.  Like his cheek!"
[Line 1176]  Mr. Masterman looked astonished.
[Line 1177] "I thought Mr. Chave----" he said.
[Line 1178]  "Exactly, vicar; you thought right.  'Tis just his handsome face makes
[Line 1179] my nephew so pushing.  We be a yeoman race, we Baskervilles, though
[Line 1180] said to be higher once; but of course, as things are, Ned looking there was just infernal impudence, though his good old pig-headed father, my brother, couldn't see it.  He's only blind when Ned's the matter."  "'Twas said he was going to jump in the river," declared the ancient Abel.  "Nonsense and rubbish!" declared Nathan.  "Ned's not that sort.  Wait
[Line 1181] till he sees himself in the glittering armour of St. George, and he'll soon forget his troubles." 
[Line 1182] "We must talk about the dresses after rehearsal.  A good many can be made at home." 
[Line 1183] "Be you going to charge at the doors?" asked Mr. Gollop.  "I don't see
[Line 1184] why for we shouldn't."
[Line 1185]  "Yes, certainly I am," answered Dennis.  "The money will go to rehanging the bells.  That's settled.  Well, remember.  And stir up Joe Voysey, Thomas.  You can do anything with him, but I can't.  Remind him about the French Eagle.  He's only got to learn six lines, but he says
[Line 1186] it makes his head ache so badly that he's sure he'll never do it." 
[Line 1187] "I'll try and fire the man's pride," declared Mr. Gollop.  "Joe's not a
[Line 1188] day over sixty-eight, and he's got a very fair share of intellect.  He shall learn it, if I've got to teach him."  "That's right.  Now I must be off."
[Line 1189] When the vicar was gone Gollop reviewed the situation created by young
[Line 1190] Masterman's energy and tact.
[Line 1191] "I never could have foreseen it, yet the people somehow make shift to
[Line 1192] do with him.  It don't say much for him, but it says a lot for us--for
[Line 1193] our sense and patience.  We'm always ready to lend the man a hand in
[Line 1194] reason, and I wish he was more grateful; but I shouldn't call him a grateful man.  Of course, this here play-acting will draw the eyes of the country on us, and he'll get the credit, no doubt; yet 'twill be us two men here in this bar--me and you, Nathan--as will make or mar all."
[Line 1195]  "I'm very glad to help him.  He's a good chap, and my sort.  Lots of fun in the man when you know him." 
[Line 1196] "Can't say I look at him like that.  He's not enough beholden to the past, in my opinion.  However, I believe he's woke up a bit to who I am and what my sister is," answered Gollop.
[Line 1197]  "Not your fault if he hasn't."
[Line 1198] "And another thing--he don't take himself seriously enough," continued the parish clerk.  "As a man I grant you he has got nought to take seriously.  He's young, and he's riddled with evil, modern ideas that would land the country in ruin if followed.  But, apart from that, as a
[Line 1199] minister he ought to be different.  I hate to see him running after the
[Line 1200] ball at cricket, like a school-child.  'Tisn't decent, and it lessens
[Line 1201] the force of the man in the pulpit come Sunday, just as it lessened the
[Line 1202] force of physician Dawe to Tavistock when he took to singing comic songs at the penny readings.  Why, 'twas money out of the doctor's
[Line 1203] pocket, as he lived to find out, too late.  When Old Master Trelawny lay dying, and they axed un to let Dawe have a slap at un, he wouldn't do it.  'Be that the man that sang the song about locking his
[Line 1204] mother-in-law into the coal-cellar?' he axed.  'The same,' said they;
[Line 1205] 'but he's a terrible clever chap at the stomach, and may save you yet
[Line 1206] if there be enough of your organs left for him to work upon.'  'No, no,' says old Trelawny.  'Such a light-minded feller as that couldn't
[Line 1207] be trusted with a dying man's belly.'  I don't say 'twas altogether reasonable, because the wisest must unbend the bow now and again; but I will maintain that that minister of the Lord didn't ought to take off his coat and get in a common sweat afore the people assembled at a cricket match.  'Tis worse than David making a circus of himself afore
[Line 1208] the holy ark; and if he does so, he must take the consequences." 
[Line 1209] "The consequences be that everybody will think a lot better of him, as a manly and sensible chap, wishful to help the young men," declared Mr.
[Line 1210] Baskerville.  "One thing I can bear witness to: I don't get the
[Line 1211] Saturday custom I used to get, and that's to the good, anyway."  Then
[Line 1212] he looked at his watch and changed the subject. 
[Line 1213] "Mrs. Lintern's daughter is paying a sort of solemn visit to my brother
[Line 1214] to-day, and they are all a little nervous about it." 
[Line 1215] "He'll terrify her out of her wits," said Mr. Gollop.  "He takes a dark delight in scaring the young people." 
[Line 1216] "'Tisn't that, 'tis his manner.  He don't mean to hurt 'em.  A
[Line 1217] difficult man, however, as I know only too well." 
[Line 1218] "If he can't get on with you, there's a screw loose in him," remarked the old man, sitting on the settle. 
[Line 1219] "I won't say that, Abel; but I don't know why 'tis that he's got no use
[Line 1220] for me."
[Line 1221]  "No loss, however," asserted Thomas.  "A cranky and heartless creature. The likes of him couldn't neighbour with the likes of us--not enough
[Line 1222] human kindness in him."
[Line 1223]  "Like our father afore him, and yet harder," explained the publican. "I can see my parent now--dark and grim, and awful old to my young
[Line 1224] eyes.  Well I remember the first time I felt the sting of him.  A terrible small boy I was--hadn't cast my short frocks, I believe--but
[Line 1225] I'd sinned in some little matter, and he give me my first flogging. And the picture I've got of father be a man with a hard, set face, with a bit of a grim smile on it, and his right hand hidden behind him.  But I knowed what was in it!  A great believer in the rod.  He beat us often--all three of us--till we'd wriggle and twine like a worm on a hook; but our uncle, the musicker, he was as different as you please--soft and gentle, like my nephew Mark, and all for spoiling childer with sweeties and toys."
[Line 1226]  Mr. Gollop rose to depart, and others entered.  Then Nathan called a pot-man and left the bar. 
[Line 1227] "I promised Mrs. Lintern as I'd go down to hear what Cora had to say,"
[Line 1228] he explained.  "I'm very hopeful that she's had the art to win
[Line 1229] Humphrey, for 'twill smooth the future a good bit for the people at Undershaugh if my brother takes to the wench.  You'd think nobody could help it--such a lovely face as she has.  However, we shall know how it
[Line 1230] fell out inside an hour or so."
[Line 1231] Meanwhile Cora, clad in her new muslin, had faced Humphrey Baskerville,
[Line 1232] and faced him alone.  For her future father-in-law expressly wished
[Line 1233] this, and Mark was from home on the occasion of his sweetheart's visit.
[Line 1234] Cora arrived twenty minutes before dinner, and watched Susan Hacker
[Line 1235] dish it up.  She had even offered to assist, but Susan would not permit it. 
[Line 1236] "Better you go into the parlour and keep cool, my dear," she said.
[Line 1237] "You'll need to be.  Master's not in the best of tempers to-day.  And your young man left a message.  He be gone to Plympton, and will be back by four o'clock; so, when you take your leave, you are to go down
[Line 1238] the Rut and meet him at Torry Brook stepping-stones, if you please." 
[Line 1239] "Where's Mr. Baskerville?"  "Taking the air up 'pon top the tor.  He bides there most mornings till the dinner hour, and he'd forget his meal altogether so often as not, but I go to the hedge and ring the dinner bell.  Then he comes down."
[Line 1240] "How can I best please him, Susan?" 
[Line 1241] "By listening first, and by talking afterwards.  He don't like a
[Line 1242] chatterbox, but he don't like young folk to be too silent neither.
[Line 1243] 'Twill be a hugeous heave-up of luck if you can get on his blind side.
[Line 1244] Few can--I warn you of that.  He's very fond of natural, wild things. If you was to talk about the flowers and show him you be fond of
[Line 1245] nature, it might be well.  However, do as you will, he'll find out the
[Line 1246] truth of 'e." 
[Line 1247] "I'm all of a tremor.  I wish you hadn't told me that."
[Line 1248]  "Mark might have told you.  Still, for your comfort it may be said
[Line 1249] you're built the right way.  You'll be near so full-blown as I be, come
[Line 1250] you pass fifty.  He hates the pinikin,[1] pin-tailed sort.  Be cheerful,  
[Line 1251] [1] _Pinikin_--delicate.
[Line 1252] eat hearty, don't leave nothing on your plate, and wait for him to say
[Line 1253] grace afore and after meat.  The rest must fall out according to your own sense and wit.  Now I be going to ring the bell." 
[Line 1254] "I half thought that he might come part of the way to meet me." 
[Line 1255] "You thought wrong, then.  He don't do that sort of thing."  "I wish Mark was here, Susan."
[Line 1256] "So does Mark.  But master has his own way of doing things, and 'tis
[Line 1257] generally the last way that other people would use."  Mrs. Hacker rang the bell, and the thin, black figure of Humphrey
[Line 1258] Baskerville appeared and began to creep down the side of the hill.  He
[Line 1259] had, of course, met Cora on previous occasions, but this was the first time that he had spoken with the girl since her betrothal.
[Line 1260] He shook hands and hoped that her mother was well. 
[Line 1261] "A harvest to make up for last year," he said.  "You ought to be lending a hand by rights."
[Line 1262]  "I don't think Mr. Baskerville would like for Polly and me to do that. 'Tis too hot," she said.  "Nathan wouldn't?  Surely he would.  Many hands make light work and
[Line 1263] save the time.  You're a strong girl, aren't you?"  "Strong as a pony, sir."  "Don't call me 'sir.'  And you're fond of wild nature and the
[Line 1264] country--so Mark tells me."
[Line 1265] "That I am, and the wild flowers."
[Line 1266]  "Why didn't you wear a bunch of 'em then?  Better them than that
[Line 1267] davered[2] rose stuck in your belt.  Gold by the look of it--the belt I mean."
[Line 1268]   [2] _Davered_--withered.
[Line 1269]  She laughed.
[Line 1270]  "I'll let you into the secret," she said.  "I wanted to be smart
[Line 1271] to-day, and so I took one of my treasures.  You'll never guess where this gold belt came from, Mr. Baskerville?"
[Line 1272]  "Don't like it, anyway," he answered.
[Line 1273]  "Why, 'twas the hat-band round my grandfather's hat!  He was a beadle up to some place nigh London; and 'twas an heirloom when he died; and
[Line 1274] mother gived it to me, and here it is."
[Line 1275]  He regarded the relic curiously.
[Line 1276] "A funny world, to be sure," he said.  "Little did that bygone man
[Line 1277] think of such a thing when he put his braided hat on his head, I'll warrant."
[Line 1278]  He relapsed into a long silence, and Cora's remarks were rewarded with no more than nods of affirmation or negation.  Then, suddenly, he broke
[Line 1279] out on the subject of apparel long after she thought that he had forgotten it. 
[Line 1280] "Terrible tearing fine I suppose you think your clothes are, young woman--terrible tearing fine; but I hate 'em, and they ill become a poor man's wife and a poor man's daughter.  My mother wore her hair
[Line 1281] frapped back light and plain, with a forehead cloth, and a little blue baize rochet over her breast, and a blue apron and short gown and
[Line 1282] hob-nailed shoon; and she looked ten thousand times finer than ever you looked in your life--or ever can in that piebald flimsy, with those
[Line 1283] Godless smashed birds on your head.  What care you for nature to put a bit of a dead creature 'pon top of your hair?  A nasty fashion, and I'm
[Line 1284] sorry you follow it."
[Line 1285]  She kept her temper well under this terrific onslaught.  "We must follow the fashion, Mr. Baskerville.  But I'll not wear this
[Line 1286] hat again afore you, since you don't like it." 
[Line 1287] "Going to be married and live up to your knees in clover, eh?  So you both think.  Now tell me what you feel like to my son, please." 
[Line 1288] "I love him dearly, I'm sure, and I think he's a very clever chap, and
[Line 1289] quite the gentleman in all his ways.  Though he might dress a bit
[Line 1290] smarter, and not be so friendly with the other bellringers.  Because they are commoner men than him, of course."  "'Quite the gentleman'--eh?  What's a gentleman?" 
[Line 1291] "Oh, dear, Mr. Baskerville, you'll spoil my dinner with such a lot of
[Line 1292] questions.  To be a gentleman is to be like Mark, I suppose--kind and
[Line 1293] quick to see what a girl wants; and to be handsome and be well thought of by everybody, and all the rest of it."
[Line 1294] "You go a bit too high at instep," he said.  "You're too vain of your pretty face, and you answer rather pertly.  You don't know what a gentleman is, for all you think yourself a fine lady.  And I'll tell
[Line 1295] you this: very few people do know what a gentleman is.  You can tell a lot about people by hearing them answer when you ask them what a gentleman is.  Where would you like to live?"
[Line 1296] "Where 'twould please Mark best.  And if the things I say offend you,
[Line 1297] I'm sorry for it.  You must make allowances, Mr. Baskerville.  I'm young, and I've not got much sense yet; but I want to please you--I
[Line 1298] want to please everybody, for that matter."  This last remark much interested her listener.  He started and looked
[Line 1299] at the girl fixedly.  Then his expression changed, and he appeared to
[Line 1300] stare through her at somebody or something beyond.  Behind Cora the old man did, indeed, see another very clearly in his mind's eye.
[Line 1301]  After a painful silence she spoke again, and her tone was troubled.
[Line 1302] "I want to say the thing that will please you, if I can.  But I must be myself.  I'm sorry if you don't like me."
[Line 1303] "You must be yourself, and so must I," he answered; "and if I'm not
[Line 1304] liking you, you're loathing me.  But we're getting through our dinner very nicely.  Will you have any more of this cherry tart?"
[Line 1305] "No, I've done well."
[Line 1306]  "You've eaten nought to name.  I've spoiled your appetite, and you--well, you've done more than you think, and taught me more than you know yourself." 
[Line 1307] She shrugged her shoulders.  "Mark says puzzling things like that sometimes."
[Line 1308]  There was another silence. 
[Line 1309] "You ride a pony, don't you?" he asked presently; and the girl brightened up.  Mr. Baskerville possessed some of the best ponies on
[Line 1310] Dartmoor, and sold a noted strain of his own raising.
[Line 1311] "He's going to make it up with a pony!" thought sanguine Cora.
[Line 1312] "I do.  I'm very fond of riding."  "Like it better than walking, I dare say?"  "Yes, I do."
[Line 1313]  "And you'd like driving better still, perhaps?" 
[Line 1314] "No, I wouldn't."
[Line 1315] "What are the strangles?" he asked suddenly and grimly.
[Line 1316] "It's something the ponies get the matter with them." 
[Line 1317] "Of course; but what is it?  How does it come, and why?  Is it infectious?  Is it ever fatal to them?"  She shook her head.  "I don't know nothing about things like that."  "No use having a pony if you don't understand it.  The strangles are
[Line 1318] infectious and sometimes fatal.  Don't forget that." 
[Line 1319] Cora felt her temper struggling to break loose.  She poured out a glass of water.
[Line 1320]  "I promise not to forget it," she answered.  "Shall I put the cheese on
[Line 1321] the table for you??
[Line 1322] "No, I thank you--unless you'll eat some."
[Line 1323]  "Nothing more, I'm sure." 
[Line 1324] "We'll walk out in the air, then.  With your love of nature, you'll
[Line 1325] like the growing things up on top of my hill.  Mark will be back for
[Line 1326] tea, I think.  But maybe you'll not stop quite so long as that." 
[Line 1327] "I'll stop just as long as you like," she said.  "But I don't want to tire you."
[Line 1328]  "You've got your mother's patience, and plenty of it, I see.  That's a
[Line 1329] good mark for you.  Patience goes a long way.  You can keep your
