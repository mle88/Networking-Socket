[Line 1] "You are sure of that?" I asked.
[Line 2] He stared at me.  "Why, everyone says so."
[Line 3]  "Everyone said four hundred years ago that the sun went round the
[Line 4] earth," I answered; "were they right?"
[Line 5]  "You don't mean to tell me," he said, "that the Burmese can work."
[Line 6] "I don't mean to tell you anything," I answered.  "Here are a quarter of a million Burmese in this district.  Find out the facts for yourself."
[Line 7]  The necessity of having to support his theories with facts seemed to
[Line 8] him unreasonable.  "But," he objected, "I can see they are lazy."  The Burman is lazy.  That is enough said.  What have facts to do with it?
[Line 9] He did not say this, but undoubtedly he was thinking it.  However, at
[Line 10] last he did find what he considered a fact.
[Line 11]  "You remember, when we rode into that village the other day about noon, the number of men we saw sleeping in the veranda?"  "True," I said. 
[Line 12] "Does not that show it?"
[Line 13] "Suppose," I said, "you had got up at four o'clock in the morning and
[Line 14] worked till ten, in the fields, would you not require a rest before going out at three o'clock again?" 
[Line 15] "Do they do that?" he asked.  "You can find out for yourself if they do or not," I answered.
[Line 16] He looked at me doubtfully.
[Line 17] "But," he objected, "it is notorious."  "So is the fact that the standard of living in Burma is very high.  How
[Line 18] do you reconcile the two?  Laziness and comfort.  The comfort is
[Line 19] evident and real, perhaps the laziness is only apparent." 
[Line 20] "A rich country," he said.
[Line 21]  "Is it?" I asked.  "Look at the dry, bare land, of which nearly all this district and most of Upper Burma are composed.  Is it rich?  You
[Line 22] have eyes to see.  You know it is not rich; why do you say it is?"
[Line 23]  He shook his head almost as if I had hurt him and searched about for a
[Line 24] defence.  "But Lower Burma is rich." 
[Line 25] "Certainly; and if you look at the export returns you will see the enormous amount of rice it grows and exports.  Is that rice the product of laziness?"  "But," he said at last in despair, "if this laziness of the Burman is untrue, how did the idea become general?"
[Line 26]  "Ah," I answered, "that is another matter.  Let us stick to one thing
[Line 27] at a time.  We are concerned now with whether it is true or not. Decide that first.  See for yourself.  Find out an ordinary man's work and I think you will find it is sufficient.  You have the opportunity
[Line 28] of judging, and unless you use that opportunity you have no right to an opinion at all."
[Line 29]  He said no more at the time, but a few days later he returned to the
[Line 30] subject.  A High Official had been opening a public work in Mandalay
[Line 31] and had made a speech.  Much of the labour for the work had been
[Line 32] Burmese, where usually such labour is imported Indian, and he referred with satisfaction to the fact.  "I am glad to see," said the High Official, "that the Burmese are taking to hard work."  My assistant
[Line 33] brought this up.  "Here is authority," he said. 
[Line 34] "Certainly," I said; "there is authority on one side; now let us look at fact on the other; whether is it better to be a peasant-proprietor
[Line 35] on your own land or a day-labourer?"
[Line 36] "The proprietor, of course," he said.  "This has been a bad year in some districts.  Crops have failed.  You
[Line 37] can read that from the weekly reports in my office.  Many cultivators
[Line 38] have had to abandon their holdings and turn to day labour.  Is that
[Line 39] good?  Are they to be congratulated on it?"
[Line 40] The boy looked downcast.
[Line 41]  "No," he admitted.
[Line 42]  "Well, then," I asked, "what will they think of a Government who says such things?" 
[Line 43] He reflected for some time.  "But," he said at length, "when one
[Line 44] authority (the High Official) says one thing and another authority
[Line 45] (you) says the reverse, what am I to believe?"
[Line 46]  Then came my opportunity.  "You are to believe nothing," I said.  "You have eyes, you have ears, you have common sense.  They are given you to
[Line 47] use and see facts for yourself.  The facts are all round you.  You will
[Line 48] never do any good work if you refuse to face facts and understand them.
[Line 49] If you are to be worth your salt as an official you will have to work
[Line 50] by sight, not by faith." 
[Line 51] He laughed.  At first he seemed puzzled; then he was pleased.  He had been educated to accept what he was told and never to question.  His mind had been stunted and the idea of exercising it again delighted
[Line 52] him.  To judge by himself was a new idea to him entirely and he
[Line 53] welcomed it.  He began to do so.  For the first time since childhood he was encouraged to use that which is the only thing worth
[Line 54] cultivating--his common sense.  But even yet he could not emancipate himself. 
[Line 55] Some time later a new subject came up.  This time it was the
[Line 56] disappearance of the Burman.  He is supposed to be dying out.  The
[Line 57] Indian is "ousting" him.  Before long there will be none left.  My
[Line 58] assistant had read it in the paper and heard it almost universally,
[Line 59] therefore it must be true.  I said nothing at the time, but that day when I went to office I sent him the volumes of the last two Census
[Line 60] tables with a short note.  "Will you kindly," I wrote, "make out for me:
[Line 61]   the Burmese population in 1891
[Line 62]   the same in 1901 
[Line 63] district by district, and let me know where there have been decreases, also increases, and the percentage of increase."  The next day he came to me with an amused expression on his face and a paper of figures in his hand.  "I have made them all out," he said, "as you wished.  Here they are." 
[Line 64] "Then," I said, "let us take the districts with the decreases first.
[Line 65] Please show me them." 
[Line 66] "There are none," he answered.  "They all show increases."  "Large?" I asked.
[Line 67]  "Yes, large," he said; "from a population of about nine million to ten
[Line 68] million in ten years is a good increase.  The Burmese are prolific." 
[Line 69] "But," I remarked also, "I thought the Burman was disappearing?  You said so on authority.  How is that?"  He laughed; he had taken his lesson. 
[Line 70] And again, another point.  I had received an order from Government which I thought was mistaken, and I said so.  He was a Government
[Line 71] official too, and I could say to him what I could not say to others. 
[Line 72] "Then you won't carry it out?"  he asked, surprised. 
[Line 73] "I am here to carry out orders," I answered, "and of course I shall carry it out."
[Line 74] "But why then do you criticise it, if it must be carried out?" 
[Line 75] "Look here," I said, "before very long you will be sent to a
[Line 76] subdivision of my district to govern it.  I shall send you many orders,
[Line 77] and shall expect you to carry them out." 
[Line 78] "Right or wrong?" 
[Line 79] "Right or--as you may think--wrong.  You must do as I say.  Without
[Line 80] this, government is impossible.  But I do not want you to think as I
[Line 81] do.  I want you to think for yourself.  If an order appears to you
[Line 82] issued from a misconception on my part, you must not refuse to obey;
[Line 83] but I should expect you to tell me any facts that would lead me to
[Line 84] better knowledge.  Your business is not merely to carry out orders, but
[Line 85] to furnish me with correct information how to better those orders.  You are not merely to be part of the district hand, but of its brain too. I should want you to criticise every order in your mind, try to
[Line 86] understand it, and if you disagree with it to examine your reasons for
[Line 87] disagreement and see if they are good." 
[Line 88] "And let you know?" 
[Line 89] "Whenever you are certain that I am wrong, and the matter is important."  "But would not criticism be cheek?"  "Not if it is true and valuable.  You would be doing me a valuable service.  It is what I want.  How do you suppose we are ever to get on
[Line 90] if opinions are to be stereotyped?  Thought must be free.  But don't
[Line 91] give me opinions or 'authority.'  I don't care for either.  Give me
[Line 92] facts, and be sure of your facts."  "I see," he said.  "You can be quite kind about it, you know," I suggested.  "Is that what you are to Government," he asked, "when you disagree with them?"
[Line 93]  "I try to be," I said.  "I put myself as far as I can in their
[Line 94] position, and give them what I would like to receive myself."
[Line 95]  Again it was quite a new idea to him that anyone should want criticism.
[Line 96] He had been educated to believe that any doubt of what authority said was a sin, perhaps inevitable sometimes, but anyhow always to be concealed; and he had been told that everyone, from the Creator down, resented criticisms and would annihilate the critic.  That anyone
[Line 97] should prefer knowing the truth even if it prove him wrong seemed to
[Line 98] him impossible.  He did not like ever to admit he had been wrong.  He thought truth was absolute and fixed, whereas it is relative and always growing.  He had, unconsciously, the mind of the Pharisee in the Temple. 
[Line 99] Now these three instances will point out what seems to me to be wrong
[Line 100] in the previous training of young men sent to India, and in fact in all training.  Their minds instead of being cultivated are stifled.  They
[Line 101] are taught to disregard fact and to accept authority in place of it. They are not only to do what they are told, which is right; but to think what they are told, which is wrong.  And they do.  They are taught to repeat in parrot manner stock phrases and imagine they are thinking.  And this habit once acquired is difficult to get rid of. With most it never is got rid of.  You will, for instance, find these shibboleths of the "disappearing Burman" and his "laziness" repeated by the highest officials who have been longest in the country, all of whom have facts in their office disproving them.  And these are not the only prejudices nor even the principal.  They are innumerable and serious. You will in consequence find that administration and even legislation
[Line 102] are affected by them.  The whole attitude of Government to the people it governs is vitiated in this way.  There is a want of knowledge and
[Line 103] understanding.  In place of it are fixed opinions based usually on prejudice or on faulty observation, or on circumstances which have changed, and they are never corrected.  Young secretaries read up back
[Line 104] circulars, and repeat their errors indefinitely.  That is "following precedent."  They will quote you complacently: 
[Line 105]   "Freedom broadening slowly down   From precedent to precedent"
[Line 106]  and never see the absurdity of the lines.  Freedom is the disregard of precedent where the precedent is wrong or out of date. 
[Line 107] There is throughout nearly all English officials (and non-officials) in India not only a disregard of facts about them, but a want of any real sympathy with the people among whom they live, which is astonishing.
[Line 108] They often like the "natives," they often are kind to them, wish them
[Line 109] well, and do their best for them, but that is not sympathy.  Sympathy
[Line 110] is understanding.  It is being able to put yourself in another's place. 
[Line 111] I could tell many stories illustrating this want of understanding.  One will suffice.  An official I knew well, an excellent fellow, kind-hearted, humorous, and able, holding a good position then and a
[Line 112] high one now, with a charming wife, living amongst the Burmese and
[Line 113] ruling them, with Burmese servants, clerks, and peons, and continual
[Line 114] Burmese visitors of all classes, called his dog "Alaung."  Now "Alaung"
[Line 115] means something very similar to "Messiah," and is a sacred word.  A
[Line 116] parallel would be if, say, a Parsee in England called his dog "Christ." I have seen this official's servants wince when he called out to his
[Line 117] dog.  Yet I am sure it never struck him that there was anything out of
[Line 118] the way in this nomenclature.  I am sure he never dreamed he would hurt anyone's feelings by it, or he would not have done it.  He certainly intended no jeer at the religion of his subordinates.  It was simply
[Line 119] that he wanted understanding.  Now sympathy is inherent in all children, and is the means whereby they
[Line 120] acquire all the real knowledge they have.  A girl being a mother to her
[Line 121] doll, a boy being a soldier or hunter, is exercising and training the most valuable of all gifts--imaginative sympathy.  It is the only emotion which brings real knowledge of the world about you.  Without it
[Line 122] you never understand anything. 
[Line 123] It should be incessantly cultivated and fed with real facts to enable it to grow, and to turn what your sympathy leads you to suspect into what knowledge confirms.  In all young men nowadays it is destroyed by
[Line 124] their education.  Their minds are fitted up with obsolete and mistaken prejudices, which are called principles, and then the door is locked.
[Line 125] They all talk the same, act the same, have the same ideas in their
[Line 126] heads.  None of them ever think over what is all about them.  They do
[Line 127] their work by paper knowledge and paper principles; the great book of humanity has been sealed for them.  When they try to think they cannot
[Line 128] do so.  They have lost the power their childhood had.  They argue in
[Line 129] the most extraordinary way.  They will make a statement, and if it is
[Line 130] disproved say, "Well, if it is not true it ought to be," and go on as
[Line 131] if that made it true.  They will resort to prophecy, and say, "If not
[Line 132] true to-day it will be to-morrow," and so settle it.
[Line 133] Now if brighter days are to be in store for India official or non-official, English or native, all this must be altered.  The whole
[Line 134] principles of education must be revised or abandoned.  The less educated a man is now the more real understanding he is likely to have. The educated man is a mental automaton.  He has sold his soul and got
[Line 135] in its place some maxims, with the aid of which he seeks to govern the
[Line 136] world.  He thinks knowledge is got from books.  It is not.  Books are
[Line 137] most valuable helps, showing you new views of life, giving you new
[Line 138] facts, showing you how to think; but they never give you knowledge of
[Line 139] life.  Only experience can do that.  But the young man now does not
[Line 140] want to know what is, but what other people say.  He is afraid of himself and yearns for authority.
[Line 141]  This has been evident to all who have looked into the matter.  Here is what a modern writer says:
[Line 142]  "No English schoolboy is ever taught to speak the truth for the very simple reason that he is never taught to desire the truth.  From the very first he is taught to be totally careless as to whether a fact is
[Line 143] a fact; he is taught to care only whether the 'fact' can be used on his side when he is engaged in 'playing the game.'" 
[Line 144] Nothing could be more true than this.  He is provided with fixed ideas,
[Line 145] and he will welcome any fact that supports them, while deliberately
[Line 146] refusing all facts which are opposed to his ideas.  He thinks and
[Line 147] argues to prove his preconceived point, never to elicit truth regardless of whether that truth agrees with his preconceptions or not. In fact, he is taught not to think.  The Inward Light which is in all
[Line 148] children has been put out.  He has become a spiritual coward; he dare not look the whole truth in the face.  He thinks that patriotism consists in supporting his country or his class through thick and thin. It does not occur to him that the higher patriotism is to try to help his country or his class not to go wrong, or if wrong to get right.  He would rather bolster up a mistake, shut his eyes to the fact that it is
[Line 149] a mistake, and go on doing it, than admit his wrong.  It is better in his eyes to be consistently wrong than by admitting mistakes and
[Line 150] correcting them to be inconsistent.  He cannot learn.
[Line 151]  
[Line 152]  CHAPTER IV
[Line 153]  HIS SUBSEQUENT TRAINING  Therefore there is a wide difference between the men as they came out
[Line 154] in the old days and as they come out now.  Then they were young, not
[Line 155] very well instructed but capable of seeing, understanding, and
[Line 156] learning; nowadays they are so drilled and instructed that they can deal only with books, papers, and records; life has been closed to them; they can enforce laws, but not temper them.  After they come out the difference of life and work is still greater.
[Line 157] In the old days, for instance, they picked up the language quickly and well.  The time to learn a language is when you are young--the younger the better.  We learn our own language as children.  The older we grow the harder it is, because it means not merely learning by heart a great
[Line 158] many words, not merely training the palate and tongue to produce different sounds, but adopting a new attitude of mind.  Nothing
[Line 159] definite has been discovered as to the localisation of faculties in the brain, therefore nothing certain is known; but it has always seemed to me and to others whom I have consulted that when you learn a new language you are exercising and developing a new piece of brain.  When
[Line 160] you know several languages and change from one to another you seem definitely to change the piece of brain which actuates your tongue.
[Line 161] You switch off one centre and switch on to another.  You will always notice in yourself and others that there is a definite pause when the change of language is made.  Now it becomes every year more difficult
[Line 162] to awaken an unused part of the brain and bring it into active use, and to begin at twenty-three is late.  True, languages are taught them at Oxford before they come out, but the result seems _nil_.  You must learn a language where it is spoken.  Moreover, the way they have been
[Line 163] taught Latin and Greek is a hindrance, for living languages are not learnt that way.  A child, for instance, learns to talk perfectly without ever learning grammar.  I never heard that any great English writer had a grounding in English grammar.  There is no real grammar of a living language, because it grows and changes.  You can only have a fixed grammar of a dead language. 
[Line 164] The fact is that correct talking is the outcome of correct thinking,
[Line 165] not of any mechanical rules.  You must think in a language before you can speak it well. 
[Line 166] But at twenty-three it is far too late for the ordinary man to learn to
[Line 167] think in Hindustani or Burmese or Tamil.  Of course there are occasional exceptions, but the way these languages are usually spoken is dreadful.  I could tell tales about myself as well as others, for though I worked very hard for years I never knew Burmese well, nor yet
[Line 168] Canarese, nor yet Hindustani.  Yet who will doubt that it is very
[Line 169] important, the most important acquisition, in fact, that you can make? Without it you can never really get near the people.  So that in this
[Line 170] way the old civilian had again a great advantage. 
[Line 171] Here is one story.  Once upon a time there was a District Officer and
[Line 172] there was his district, and for some reason they did not seem to agree.
[Line 173] At least the district did not like its Head.  It felt uneasy, and it became restive, and at last it complained.  It took up many grievances, and amongst them was this: "There is a good deal of building wanted in
[Line 174] various parts, and there is timber and there are sawyers, but no
[Line 175] licences can be obtained.  When the Head comes round on tour we ask
[Line 176] him, but he always refuses.  So all building work is stopped."
[Line 177]  An Inspecting Officer went to inquire, and he began with this complaint: "Why do you refuse them sawpit licences when on tour?" he
[Line 178] asked.
[Line 179] "I don't," the Head replied.
[Line 180]  "They say you do."
[Line 181] "But they never even applied; so how could I refuse?" he answered.  "Very well," said the Inspecting Officer, "let's see the file of your petitions received."
[Line 182] A clerk brought it out, and there--written in Burmese, of course--were many sawpit applications, and below each, written by the Head, was his endorsement: 
[Line 183] "I cannot allow more guns to be issued."  Then the machine of government was far less perfected than it is now.
[Line 184] There were, of course, laws and rules and there was supervision, but to nothing like the present extent.  The district officer then had a
[Line 185] personality.  He was required to have one, for local conditions differed more than they do now and he had far more latitude.  Moreover,
[Line 186] the machine being less effective he depended a great deal upon his
[Line 187] personal influence to keep the place quiet and get things done.  He could not ask for orders because there was no telegraph, and he could
[Line 188] not get help quickly because there were no railways.  Therefore he was obliged to acquire a personal knowledge of people and peoples, of individuals and castes and races, which, he thinks, is not so necessary now.  The result was that all laws and orders passed through his personality before reaching the people, thus acquiring a humanity and reasonableness that is now impossible.  He studied his district and he used his powers, legal and otherwise, as he found best.  If he found a law harsh--and in the last resort all laws are so--he would ameliorate its action.  Nowadays he cannot do that.  In the old days he
[Line 189] administered, as best he could, justice; now he administers law--a very wide difference.  Thus he was forced by circumstances to acquire a
[Line 190] knowledge and a sympathy which are unattainable to-day; for you only
[Line 191] learn things by doing them.
[Line 192]  The old district officers were known personally by name and by
[Line 193] reputation all through their districts.  The people looked to them for
[Line 194] help and understanding, and protection as much against the rigidity and
[Line 195] injustice of the laws as against other ills. 
[Line 196] But nowadays, except the Government officials and headmen, I don't
[Line 197] believe anyone in a district knows who the head is.  At all events, it
[Line 198] makes practically no difference, because the application of the laws is supervised and enforced, and the district officer must "fall into
[Line 199] line."  If any personality has survived his schooling it must now be
[Line 200] killed. 
[Line 201] Few men, I think, learn anything except from two motives--a natural driving desire or necessity.  But a natural desire to study the people round you is scarce, and the necessity of other days has passed away.
[Line 202] A district officer can now do his work quite to the satisfaction of Government and know next to nothing of the people.  In fact, sometimes
[Line 203] knowledge leads to remonstrance with Government, and it doesn't like that.
[Line 204]  Again, there has crept into secretariats a cult of "energy" and "efficiency," and a definition of these words, which acts disastrously upon the district officer, both when he is under training and
[Line 205] subsequently. 
[Line 206] Now, the proper meaning of an "efficient officer" is, I take it, one
[Line 207] who sees the right thing to do and does it quickly and effectively; and
[Line 208] probably Government really has this in its mind when it uses the word. This is what it wants; but very often what it gets is almost the opposite, and it is as pleased with this as if it got what it expected.
[Line 209] In fact, it does not seem to know the difference.  An example will explain what I mean.
[Line 210] There is, we will say, in a district a good deal of cattle theft going on, and the thieves cannot be detected.  Cattle graze in Burma in the
[Line 211] fields, and in the jungle on their outskirts; they roam about a good deal, and it is easy enough to steal them; detection is difficult.
[Line 212] But there is in Burma, as in parts of India, a provision of the Village Regulation which is called the Track Law, and it is substantially as
[Line 213] follows:
[Line 214]  If cattle are missing their tracks can be followed.  When they pass out
[Line 215] of the area under the jurisdiction of the village wherein the owner lives and enter another village lands, that village becomes responsible.  The tracker calls the headman of that village and shows him the tracks, which he must follow up and demonstrate that they have
[Line 216] not stopped in his jurisdiction but gone on.  In this way the tracks can be followed till they are lost, when the village in whose land they
[Line 217] are lost is considered as being the village of the thief, and is
[Line 218] therefore responsible for the lost cattle.  It can be fined, and the
[Line 219] owner of the lost bullock indemnified.
[Line 220]  This Act is taken from a very old custom common once in most of India, and also, I believe, in places of Europe.  For several hundred years
[Line 221] ago, when villages were widely separated by jungle, it had some sense.
[Line 222]  There was then a presumption either that the stolen bullock had been taken to that village, or that some of the villagers had seen it pass.
[Line 223] The thief would probably have stopped there for food or rest, as it was
[Line 224] a long way on.  But nowadays, in most of the country, village fields
[Line 225] are conterminous, with little or no jungle between; there are many roads, and except where the tracks actually go into the village gate the presumption does not arise.  Cattle are common, and the villagers
[Line 226] are not expert trackers.  Moreover, there is a very strong premium on dishonesty, or at least carelessness in keeping to the right tracks.
[Line 227] Suppose the right track lost in a wet place, or a dry bare place, why
[Line 228] not pick up some other?  Most cattle tracks are very similar.  The
[Line 229] owner wants his compensation. 
[Line 230] Yet the "energetic" officer will be expected to work this Act _à pied de la lettre_.
[Line 231] I saw a good deal of the actual working of this Act at one time, when I was a subordinate officer.  Every time a beast was lost it had to be
[Line 232] tracked, and the village where the tracks were lost had to pay.  It made no difference if there was any reasonable presumption against the
[Line 233] village, there the law was.  The tracks might be lost two miles from the actual village, simply crossing its boundary; the law was there. 
[Line 234] I remember one village had a bad time because it was near a frequented road, and when the tracks got on this road they were always lost, as the surface was hard.  So the village had to pay.  Yet what evidence was there against the village?  None.  I had the curiosity for some
[Line 235] time, whenever a case wherein a village was fined was subsequently detected, to find out what village had been fined, and see if that village had been in any way cognisant of the theft.  It never had.  The fine was purely gratuitous, was worse than useless, for it was wrong. 
[Line 236] Yet it is a Government rule--not, I think, actually laid down, but understood--that whenever an offence occurs, unless the culprit is arrested a village must be held responsible.
[Line 237]  I always disliked the Track Law and its subsidiary sections, not
[Line 238] because I have any objection to holding a village, in certain cases, responsible for its members--I think it is a sound principle--but because it always hit innocent people, as far as I could see.  I used
[Line 239] it as little as I could, yet there were difficulties.  I will mention a case in point.  There was a broker who lived not in my district but near its boundary,
[Line 240] and one day he rode to a village in my district to collect some debts. He didn't collect them, and left the village in a rage, saying he would
[Line 241] complain to the police-station six or seven miles away that he had been cheated.  It was about four o'clock in the afternoon when he left, and he rode off across the plain in the direction of the police-station. 
[Line 242] He was sighted at dusk near the river, going along a road which half a mile farther on passed through a village, and no more was seen of him. He never arrived at the police-station, and next morning his pony was
[Line 243] found roaming the plain about the village near which he had last been seen.
[Line 244]  There was no sign of him or his body.  He was a well-known man, reputed to be wealthy, and a great fuss was made.  His wife declared he must have been murdered.  The magistrate of
[Line 245] the broker's district was indignant that "his" broker should have been murdered in my district and I do nothing.  My police could get no clue at all, nor could I.  A subordinate magistrate held a proceeding under the Track Law against the village where the broker disappeared, and
[Line 246] recommended it be fined.  I, however, held my hand.
[Line 247]  Then a body was found floating in the river some miles lower down, and identified as the broker's body, and his wife gave it a funeral.  Still
[Line 248] I held my hand.
[Line 249] My neighbour was indignant; my Superintendent of Police was distressed at me; my Commissioner evidently thought me slack--"no energy."  The fact is I was puzzled, and would do nothing till I saw clearly.  So six
[Line 250] months went on. 
[Line 251] What would have happened eventually had nothing more come out I can't say, but something more did come out--the broker came out.  He was recognised in Mandalay and immediately arrested--for pretending to be alive when he was really dead, I suppose--and sent to me.  I asked him what had occurred, and he confessed that he was deeply in debt to
[Line 252] money-lenders and had made up this scheme to defeat them.  He had left his pony, gone down to the river, crossed in a canoe, and gone into hiding.  While he was "dead" his wife had compounded with his creditors.
[Line 253]  I sent him back to my neighbour with the emphatic warning that if his broker ever came up my way again he would certainly be done for in good earnest.  The whole district had been turned upside down for him, and
[Line 254] he was not popular. 
[Line 255] Now the points that I wish all this to illustrate are these: Men at the
[Line 256] head-quarters of Government, out of touch with real life, read the Track Law, think it most useful and just, and insist on its being
[Line 257] enforced.  Officers on the spot, accustomed to accept all law as the
[Line 258] epitome of justice, follow the Act without thinking.  The responsibility is really on them, as Government tells them to judge
[Line 259] each case on its merits, but they fear that if they reported that no
[Line 260] case under the Track Law ever had any merits they would be written down as "wanting in energy."  As they have not been trained to think for
[Line 261] themselves, they do not do so.  They fulfil all the requirements of the Act, and are satisfied.  Moreover, subsequently, to justify their own
[Line 262] action they must praise the Act.  Therefore a vicious circle is created.  Government says: "District officers praise the Act, therefore
[Line 263] have it stringently enforced, for they know its actual value."  And
[Line 264] district officers say: "Government declares this to be an admirable Act, therefore I must enforce it."  No one ever investigates the facts.
[Line 265] If a district officer have doubts, he discreetly smothers them as
[Line 266] babies, lest they grow. 
[Line 267] And this is but one instance.  I mention in a later chapter a still
[Line 268] more striking case of this sort of action; and even many examples would not expose its whole evil.  It is the spirit that renders such things
[Line 269] possible that is disastrous.  So are officers trained to believe that when anything untoward happens they must do something--they must punish somebody.  The idea that if they act without full knowledge the something they do will be wrong and the persons they punish will be innocent is not allowed to intrude.  They will, of course, always act by law, but then, "_summum jus, summa injuria_."  In the old days this
[Line 270] could not have happened.  In the first place, Government trusted its officers, and its trust was not misplaced; now it trusts its laws; yet there is nothing so unintelligent, nothing so fatal as rigid laws--except those who believe in them.  In the second place, officers
[Line 271] with the personality and knowledge of the men of former days would have
[Line 272] insisted on seeing for themselves and judging for themselves.  They
[Line 273] would have cared nothing that they might be supposed not to have "energy."  They would know they had something better than that--they
[Line 274] had understanding.
[Line 275]  The possibility of making our laws and our government generally
[Line 276] endurable to the people depends on the personality of the district
[Line 277] officer.  Nowadays he is sent out with his personality crushed, and it gets still
[Line 278] more crushed out there.  He becomes in time not a living soul but a
[Line 279] motor-engine to drive a machine.  Whatever knowledge he acquires is of
[Line 280] the people's faults and not their virtues.  When you hear an official
[Line 281] praised as "knowing the Indian" or "the Burman," you know that it means that he knows his faults.  He knows the criminal trying to escape, the villager trying to evade revenue.  It doesn't mean that he knows more than this.  Some do, especially among the police and the forest officers, but then they have no influence.
[Line 282] As showing the difference between the old officer and the new I make
[Line 283] the following extract from _A City of Sunshine_, by Alexander
[Line 284] Allardyce.  Few books on the East have been written with a clearer
[Line 285] understanding.  "Mr. Eversley, the collector, was an official of a type that has almost passed away.  He had been brought up in the strictest traditions of the
[Line 286] Haileybury school and had adhered all his life to the conservative
[Line 287] principles of the 'old civilianism.'  When the 'Competition Wallah' came in, Eversley foresaw certain ruin to the English interests in
[Line 288] India.  'Competition Wallahs!' he used to exclaim--'as well put the
[Line 289] country under a commission of schoolmasters at once.  But we'll lose the country with all this Latin and Greek; take my word for it we'll soon lose the country.'  Mr. Eversley had never been able to make a hexameter in the whole course of his life, and there is grave reason to doubt that he was ignorant of even the barest elements of the Greek
[Line 290] accidence.  But he had acquired a marvellous colloquial familiarity
[Line 291] with the Eastern vernaculars, and he knew the habits and feelings of
[Line 292] the Bengalee better than any other officer in the Lower Provinces. There was no chance of Eversley falling into such a blunder as that
[Line 293] which was laid to the charge of Muffington Prigge, the magistrate of
[Line 294] the neighbouring district of Lallkor, who once, in taking the deposition of a witness in a criminal case, had expressed his displeasure that evidence of such importance should be given on the
[Line 295] authority of a third person, and ordered the police to bring 'Fidwi' before him.  The witness gave his evidence in the third person out of respect.  Instead of saying 'I saw' he said 'Fidwi (your slave) saw.'
[Line 296] Muffington Prigge's judgments had been more than once spoken of with
[Line 297] encomiums by Mr. Justice Tremer in the Appeal side of the High Court,
[Line 298] but Mr. Eversley's law never came before the High Court except to be
[Line 299] reprobated.  Lawyers complained that he did not know even the rudiments of the Codes; but there was no magistrate in the Lower Provinces whose
[Line 300] decisions were received with more general satisfaction or from whose
[Line 301] judgments there were fewer appeals.  His rough-and-ready way of
[Line 302] settling cases was better relished than the elaborate findings of the Lallkor archon which were generally unintelligible to the suitors till they had fee'd their lawyer to tell them which side had won.
[Line 303] "The people knew that Eversley would do what he saw to be right, independent of Act or Code, _and they had more confidence in his sense of justice than in the written law_."
[Line 304]  What is the highest praise a Burman will give to an officer--that he is clever, painstaking, honest, energetic, kind?  No; but that he has "auza."  And what is "auza"?  It is that influence and power that comes from personality.  Who has "auza" nowadays?  No one, not even Government.  It has become, as Eversley expected, a Commission of
[Line 305] Schoolmasters. 
[Line 306]    CHAPTER V 
[Line 307] CRIMINAL LAW 
[Line 308] Let us turn now from the _personnel_ of government to its methods, from its men to its laws, from the motive power to the machine it works, or
[Line 309] which more often now works government. 
[Line 310] The first subject that comes naturally to our view is the prevention and suppression of crime, for in point of time that precedes all else. When you are conquering a country, after the soldiers have partly done their work and the civil power comes in, its first care is to create
[Line 311] and maintain peace.  It organises a police and appoints magistrates. Thus in point of time the Criminal Courts are the first to be organised and criminal law to be laid down, and they are the foundation-stone on which all else is built.  And they remain always the most important of
[Line 312] the functions of government.  If they work well, then there is a good beginning made, but if ill, then the outlook is bad.  If what should be Courts of Justice cease in the opinion of the people to be so, then is the very foundation-stone of your rule dissolving.  The whole edifice is undermined; it is not founded on a rock, but on something that
[Line 313] decays, which soon will give way and let down everything.  Let us go back therefore to the beginning, and see how things worked
[Line 314] then.  The laws were few, were crude, were often bad.  It must be remembered that a hundred years ago the penal laws in England were the most savage, the most useless, the most wicked the world has ever seen. The law in India could not therefore be expected to be very good.  But
[Line 315] previous to our rule there was no law at all generally.  And these bad
[Line 316] laws of ours came to the people through the medium of personalities who
[Line 317] were for the most part intelligent and sympathetic.  Moreover, there was nothing like the number of cases then as now.  The system now obliges all cognisable crime to be reported even if petty in its
[Line 318] nature.  In those days very little crime was reported, it was dealt with by the village communities and never known to the Courts.  There were few pleaders; and a trial was really what it ought to be, an
[Line 319] inquiry into facts by a magistrate desiring to know them.  The question of personality came in a great deal, and whatever may be alleged of the ordinary district courts of those days, they were human, they really tried to be Courts of Justice, they tried to understand.  The people respected them.  If they did not respect the law, at all events they respected the magistrate who tried to do his best with it.  They had an
[Line 320] admiration for his personality which went a long way.  Now that is all changed. 
[Line 321] The law has been greatly improved.  It has been codified by trained legists; Lord Macaulay and Sir James Stephen were two of them, and it
[Line 322] is up to the standard of European codes.  But, on the other hand, it has been made absolute.  There is a reign of law now, and there is no
[Line 323] person in the world who does not hate law when he sees it.  The
[Line 324] personality that softened it in the old days has been ruled out.  The High Courts supervise all work and reduce it to a dead level of
[Line 325] uniformity.  There is even a fixed scale of punishment sometimes.  On
[Line 326] revision, cases are rejudged on the written evidence alone.  Of course,
[Line 327] the case cannot be altered on revision, but the magistrate can be
[Line 328] admonished--and he is.  All humanity is eliminated. 
[Line 329] Therefore the Courts are despised and hated by the people, who misuse them in every way they can.
[Line 330]  Let us look into this matter.  In the first place, let me explode a common fallacy.  It is frequently
[Line 331] said that Oriental people do not dislike crime, that they condone it,
[Line 332] that they have low standards in matters of current morality.  Therefore
[Line 333] they are not anxious to have crime brought to justice as we are.  They are a bad lot, and the criminal being but a trifle worse than the
[Line 334] average they sympathise with him.
[Line 335] All that is wicked nonsense.  Standards in the East are the same as they are elsewhere.  The people dislike crime as much as we do.  But they think our laws and Courts are not calculated to reduce crime, and
[Line 336] they have good reason for so thinking.  Moreover, they distinguish
[Line 337] between the sinner and his sin--we don't.  There lies the difference. Let us consider, therefore, the Courts and their relation to the people.
[Line 338] I confine myself to the province of Burma which I know best, but there is little difference between it and other provinces in these matters.
[Line 339] The law is uniform, the procedure uniform, and what differences exist are due to interference of the High Courts acting within the law.  In
[Line 340] the Indian Penal Code are laid down definitions of the various
[Line 341] offences; what it is that constitutes theft, or robbery, or murder.  It
[Line 342] was drawn out by skilled and able men from the experience of all civilised nations.  It is not, of course, perfect; no code could be
[Line 343] that or near it, but it is good.  With most of it the people have no quarrel.  A theft is the same anywhere, and so is a murder.  With one
[Line 344] point, however, they profoundly disagree, and that is the
[Line 345] classification of offences.  Theft, no matter how trivial, is an offence against the State, is not compoundable, and is cognisable by
[Line 346] the police; whereas an assault, no matter how severe, unless it causes grievous hurt, is the opposite.  It is a purely private matter, with which the police have no business.  If the sufferer wants to prosecute he must do so himself; pay his own expenses and engage his own pleader,
[Line 347] or go without.  This is a difference that offends his own instinct.
[Line 348] Just take two cases.
[Line 349] Your servant steals a little silver ornament, a few rupees you left
[Line 350] about; or some hungry loafer takes some fruit off your tree.  You may
[Line 351] not forgive him, you may not overlook it.  You are bound by law to tell the police and get the offender arrested and convicted.  By the petty
[Line 352] theft public morality has been outraged, and you must assist morality to vindicate itself.  You have no option.  If you do not tell the police, you are "compounding a felony," and may be punished.  Having told the police you will have no further trouble.  They will get up the
[Line 353] case, look up evidence, summon the witnesses, prosecute the case, and you will be paid for giving evidence.  The thief will be sent to gaol.
[Line 354] But if your enemy meets you in the fields, knocks you down, rolls you
[Line 355] in the dust, dishonours and abases you in your own esteem and before all who know of it, public morality is not offended.  It is of no use
[Line 356] going to the police-station; they will not listen to you, they will not
[Line 357] prosecute, nor take any notice.  If you desire justice you must go yourself to Court, pay to have a petition written, pay for a stamp, get an advocate and pay him, pay for summonses to witnesses, spend, say,
[Line 358] three or four pounds, and eventually your enemy may be fined five
[Line 359] shillings, of which you, if lucky, may get two as compensation.  You
[Line 360] may, if you like, at any time withdraw your complaint, if, for
[Line 361] instance, your enemy apologises to you or compensates you.  Now these
[Line 362] are not selected cases, exaggerated cases, nor unusual cases.  They are common, and in both cases the instincts of the people are outraged.
[Line 363] They are not sordid-minded.  A petty theft is not to them a very
[Line 364] serious thing.  They put a higher value on their personal dignity and self-respect than on a trifling piece of property.  To them, therefore,
[Line 365] all this is wrong.  Theft is never a very deadly offence, and if of small things is easily forgiven.  _But they may not forgive_.  If the
[Line 366] police hear of it, they must give evidence against the culprit--or must lie.  They lie.  Who blames them?  The concealment of thefts, the
[Line 367] refusal to report them to the police, the subsequent refusal to give
[Line 368] evidence, are common.  Is theirs the fault?  On the other hand, as it
[Line 369] is impossible in the Courts to get any satisfaction for an assault, the
[Line 370] hot-tempered Burman seeks revenge in other ways.  The Court fails him, so he takes the law into his own hands.  He will waylay, will stab, will sometimes murder.  Then Government grieves over the large number
[Line 371] of serious-hurt cases and wonders what causes them.  The wily Madrassi or Bengali coolie gets square in a different way.  The injured complainant goes off straight to the police-station and there describes the assault more or less correctly.  This, of course, he knows will not
[Line 372] help him, so he adds as follows: "During the assault a rupee dropped out of my pocket, and when A had finished battering me he picked up the
[Line 373] rupee and went off with it."  This makes the offence "theft," which is cognisable by the police, who go off and arrest B and lock him up.  Of
[Line 374] course, at the trial the experienced magistrate detects the truth,
[Line 375] firmly disbelieves the rupee, and convicts A of an assault only.  But B
[Line 376] is quite satisfied.  Has not A been locked up for a week?  The perspective therefore of the Indian Penal Code is wrong.  It is taken from English law, which is also wrong, that is, opposed to common
[Line 377] sense.  How it arose I know, but this is not the place to enter into
[Line 378] that.
[Line 379] Therefore the very definition and classification of offences are
[Line 380] repugnant to the people, and are themselves causes of evasion: the
[Line 381] Indian Penal Code itself is wrong.  But that is nothing to the wrong-headedness of the Criminal Procedure Code. 
[Line 382] For whereas the Penal Code only partly offends the people, the Court procedure is wrong from top to bottom.  Its very foundation principle
[Line 383] is wrong. 
[Line 384] What is its principle of a trial?  Is it a means of finding out the truth?  Is it an impartial inquiry into what has happened?  Not in the least.  A trial is a duel.  It is the lineal descendant of the duels of the Middle Ages.  The place is changed, it is a Court and not a field; weapons are witnesses and tongues, not swords nor spears; the parties fight by champions, not in person, and the umpire is called a judge, but the principle is the same.  Take any criminal trial.  On one side is the Crown prosecutor, on the other the advocate of the accused.
[Line 385] They fight.  All through the case they fight.  The prosecutor calls his witnesses, asks them only the questions the answers to which will help
[Line 386] his case.  The other champion cross-examines, bullies, confuses them, tries to make them contradict themselves, drags in irrelevant matter,
[Line 387] and tries to destroy what the other side has built.  When the defence
[Line 388] is on, the state of affairs is reversed.  Neither wants the truth, and
[Line 389] only the truth, and all the truth.  Each plays to win, and that alone. If either knows evidence which would help the other side he suppresses
[Line 390] it.  The judge is almost helpless.  He has to take what is given.  He
[Line 391] sees _lacunae_ in the evidence, he cannot fill them.  He can't get down
[Line 392] from off the bench and go out into the country finding evidence for
[Line 393] himself.  He knows that every witness brought before him has been
[Line 394] tutored--not directly perhaps, but indirectly by suggestion, by
[Line 395] question, by influence.  The case is cooked before it reaches him, and therefore hopeless.  He knows he never finds out the exact truth about
[Line 396] any single thing.  How should he?  He knows and sees that witnesses are lying.  He knows the reason, because it is a duel, and they are, on one
[Line 397] side or another, fighting for vengeance, fighting for liberty.  He
[Line 398] knows that though they are a singularly truthful people outside, yet inside, their consciences absolve them from the necessity of truth because the Court is so constituted as not to be a place for an inquiry
[Line 399] into truth, but the arena of a duel.  He sees cases bought and sold.  A clever barrister or advocate will
[Line 400] secure an acquittal where a cheaper man would fail.  That is notorious
[Line 401] everywhere.  Otherwise how do great barristers come by their big fees?
[Line 402] Clients do not pay for nothing.  A barrister is worthy of his hire. The poor man loses and the rich man wins.  The poor man goes to gaol,
[Line 403] the rich is acquitted or gets a light sentence.  So it happens everywhere.  The exact truth of a case is never known.  For twenty
[Line 404] years I was a magistrate and judge.  I tried hundreds of cases and I did my best with each.  But I never once reached my own standard of
[Line 405] understanding.  What is that standard?  Not that of Courts of Appeal
[Line 406] who generally upheld my cases.  My standard was this: Do I know enough
[Line 407] of the case to write a story embodying it if I wanted to?  I never did. For the standard of truth that goes to even the slightest story is very far beyond what is required or possible in even the most carefully heard case. 
[Line 408] Now this is not an edifying state of things.  It is not edifying
[Line 409] anywhere, and I have often heard remarks about it in England from men who happened into a court of law to hear a case.  To judges, lawyers,
[Line 410] and barristers this view of the proceedings does not occur, because they have been brought up to it, and therefore their minds are locked as far as really appreciating it goes.  In India and Burma it is even less edifying.  I have often heard Burmans talk of it.  "Here on one side are the police, trained men, with all the power and resource of a great Government behind them, trying to get a conviction.  They have
[Line 411] gone about the country, searched out evidence, tested it, summoned it,
[Line 412] and displayed it to its best effect in Court.  On the other side is a
[Line 413] poor devil of a villager who has been locked up while the police were free; who is poor, who is ignorant, who if he can afford a pleader at
[Line 414] all can only afford a very indifferent one.  His case is not presented at all, or is very badly presented.  True, the case has to be clearly proved or he is acquitted, but the same facts may wear very different colours, according to whether the whole truth is known or only a half.
[Line 415] The magistrate does his best, but he can only act on the evidence.  The
[Line 416] police want a conviction because otherwise their records are bad and
[Line 417] promotion is stopped.  Do you wonder that sympathy is often with the
[Line 418] accused?"
[Line 419]  So I have often been asked; and I don't wonder.  I often felt that way
[Line 420] myself.  When a man first falls into an offence his immediate instinct is to confess to somebody.  That is true of all the world.  In Burma at the
[Line 421] beginning he used to confess to the Court.  He was sorry for his offence, he wanted to make the best of it, wanted help to reform.  He wanted understanding.  He thought the Court wanted to know the truth
[Line 422] and he would do all he could to help.  But he very soon found the
[Line 423] uselessness of this.  He got no understanding, no sympathy, only conviction and a vindictive punishment.  Naturally he reflected, and
[Line 424] pleaders and people who knew the Courts helped him to reflect.
[Line 425] "Fight it out.  At worst you can but lose and be no worse off than if
[Line 426] you confessed.  Why tell the truth?  _No one expects you to_.  If you
[Line 427] have confessed withdraw your confession.  Say you were tortured.  A trial is a fight, with the judge as umpire.  Do your best.  Remember that, even if your offence be a very small one, if it is a cognisable
[Line 428] offence you will be ruined for life if convicted."  That is the advice he gets.  Who will doubt but that, our Courts being what they are, it is sound as a rule?  So, because it is a fight he won't confess; he
[Line 429] plays for the big stake--acquittal; and sometimes this acts
[Line 430] disastrously too.  I will tell a case in point--one I tried myself. 
[Line 431] A man was accused of maiming a bullock.  It had trespassed into his Indian-corn field, and had been found there afterwards hamstrung, and had to be destroyed.  It was proved that accused was in the field when
[Line 432] the bullock wandered in.  It was also proved that accused's chopper was
[Line 433] found close to the maimed bullock, covered with blood.  Accused had run
[Line 434] away and had only been arrested some days later.
[Line 435]  Now the malicious maiming of a valuable bullock is a serious offence. Its seriousness partly depends on the value of the animal.  The case was quite clearly proved though no one actually saw the offence committed.  The defence of the accused was a futile _alibi_.  He had a
[Line 436] pleader who arranged this.  The evidence for the prosecution seemed quite clear, and I did not see how I could avoid convicting the man of
[Line 437] the grave offence.  Yet somehow I was not quite happy in my mind.  I
[Line 438] believed the prosecution was substantially true, but that they had been
[Line 439] piling it on a good deal.  So before adjourning the case till next day
[Line 440] to give me time to write the judgment, I said to the accused: 
[Line 441] "I don't believe your _alibi_.  You can see for yourself it has no sense.  But maybe if you told me your side of the story it might not look so bad for you as it does now."
[Line 442]  He looked at me, hesitated, looked at his pleader, then all of a sudden
[Line 443] he did bring the whole story out.
[Line 444] And as he told it, though it did not in any way invalidate the evidence for the prosecution, it did put the matter in quite a new light. 
[Line 445] In the first place, the cattle, of which the bullock was one, had been wilfully driven into his field to annoy him and cause him loss.  In the
[Line 446] second place, he had not deliberately cut the bullock; when he saw the cattle coming through the six-foot-high corn towards him he had in a
[Line 447] passion thrown his chopper at the dimly seen moving mass of cattle. Then he had dodged out of their way.  When he found afterwards what
[Line 448] damage he had done he ran away in a fright.
[Line 449] I found there was evidence to support what he said--for instance, he had gone straight home and told his father before he ran away--so he
[Line 450] got off with a small fine.  He might have got two years.  But unless he
[Line 451] had confessed I could never have guessed that there was quite another version of the facts.  Now I have often suspected this state of affairs.  The substance of the prosecution is clear, but there might be extenuating circumstances. The accused however fights it to the last and will admit nothing.  On
[Line 452] the evidence I could but take a gloomy view; for, remember, all cases are subject to revision by the High Court, who simply read through the
[Line 453] written evidence and are not able to appreciate the subtle effect of tone and manner in witnesses, which tell more sometimes than their words. 
[Line 454] I have said that the people have no respect for the Courts because they have lost all respect for the magistrate or judge.  In himself he may
[Line 455] be worthy of all confidence; but when on the bench he is not himself, he is a mouthpiece of the law, or an umpire; he is not a living force.
[Line 456] When you lie in Court you do not deceive a human being who is doing his best for you and others; you only try to counterbalance the injustice of the law by a little judicious weighting of the scales.  A man who
[Line 457] will tell you the truth as individual to individual will commit perjury before you in Courts and think nothing of it.  In fact, he lies at the other side, and doesn't consider you at all.  He does it to try to get
[Line 458] justice, or what he thinks is justice, in place of law, which otherwise is all he would get.  I have often been told this, and I notice the
[Line 459] same in England.  Truth is a relationship of persons; in a Court now the only persons are the two opponents; the judge is only a sort of machine to weigh evidence.  As man to man I have found Orientals as truthful as Englishmen.  In twenty-six years' experience I do not remember ever having been told a deliberate lie as man to man.  But in
[Line 460] the Courts you are not a man, you are an official, and even as an
[Line 461] official your hands are tied.  The parties have no direct relationship with you.  Their relationship is with each other--just as in a duel or
[Line 462] a prize-fight the relationship is between party and party, and the umpire is only the onlooker, who may or may not see most of the game. In law he usually sees less because Justice is blind.  I am aware that the bandage over the eyes of Justice is supposed to render her just,
[Line 463] not discriminating between rich and poor; it does the reverse, of course.  And until Justice opens her eyes again to discriminate what is
[Line 464] put into her scales she will remain the mock she now is.
[Line 465] In a previous book I have discussed the question of veracity in this connection, and lest anyone should object that what I say is true only of the Burmese I will add this story, which is of a well-known official
[Line 466] in the North-West in his younger days. 
[Line 467] He was inquiring into a Revenue case, and incidentally an Indian
[Line 468] gentleman gave him certain information.  The official thought this so
[Line 469] important that he summoned the Indian to Court, where, much to the Englishman's surprise, the Indian as a witness gave a totally different story. 
[Line 470] They met again, however, later, and the official asked the Indian
[Line 471] gentleman what he meant by going back on his words like that.  The
[Line 472] latter smiled, hesitated, and then the wisdom of experience spoke to the altruism of ignorance in these words: "Sahib," he said, "you are
[Line 473] very young."
[Line 474]  How the Courts are generally regarded by the people can best be
[Line 475] illustrated by giving an account of a dramatic entertainment I
[Line 476] witnessed once.  The Burmese are fond of the drama.  They have old
[Line 477] dramas, and they have new dramas up to date--satires for the most part.
[Line 478] The play I saw was of the latter.  The company was a well-known one,
[Line 479] which had toured almost all the province, and its most famous piece was that I witnessed--I forget the name. 
[Line 480] The scene was supposed to be the office of a lawyer, barrister, or
[Line 481] advocate, and there was a native clerk.  To him entered a would-be litigant.  The clerk listens to him for a few minutes and then asks him
[Line 482] if he has brought any money.  The client says "No."  The clerk rises in indignation and the client is hustled out.
[Line 483]  He returns with a bag of money.  The clerk then listens and the client explains his case.  The clerk demands if there is any evidence.  The client is puzzled and asks what evidence is required.  The clerk then
[Line 484] tells him slowly and distinctly: you must have a man to swear to this,
[Line 485] another to swear to that, a third to swear to something else.
[Line 486] The client remonstrates, saying he doubts if he can get so much
[Line 487] evidence.  The clerk then tells him that if he cannot get the evidence demanded his master will not take up his case.  "But," says the client indignantly, "it is a true case."  "What does that matter?" asks the clerk cynically.  "No Court cares--or can tell if it did care--whether
[Line 488] your case is true or not.  It can only tell if you have evidence or
[Line 489] not.  If you can't get the evidence your case may be the truest in the
[Line 490] world, but that won't help you."
[Line 491] The client then wants his money back, but the clerk clings to the bag
[Line 492] and the client is again thrown out.  The play was a long one, and I can only give a résumé of parts of it.  The client goes looking for
[Line 493] witnesses in the village.  He gets hold of one man and says: "Come and give evidence."  "But I saw nothing," says the villager.  "And," says the client indignantly, "would you let me, an old friend, lose what you know is a right cause just because you didn't happen to see a trifle like that?  What does it matter if you didn't actually see it?  It did
[Line 494] happen.  I am not asking you to tell a lie or invent anything." 
[Line 495] So he gets his witnesses and takes them to the clerk.  The clerk takes down their statements.  The last scene is in Court, and the client's advocate appears to plead for him.  He does so with a tongue two feet in length.  But still he loses his case, for the advocate on the other side has a tongue three feet long.  That this play was the success it
[Line 496] proved to be shows clearly that the audience saw nothing unnatural in
[Line 497] it.  In fact, they relished it immensely.
[Line 498]  The magistrate was a stuffed figure. 
[Line 499]  CHAPTER VI  PENAL LAW  There is a further difference in their view of crime, between Englishmen as they are made by education and Orientals who in some ways remain the natural man, which greatly affects the Courts, that is the
[Line 500] punishment due for crime.
[Line 501] In England we have had the most cruel penal laws ever known.  It is not a hundred years ago that there were two hundred and twenty-three
[Line 502] different offences for which the capital punishment was awarded.  I wonder if people nowadays ever realise their horrors.  I have an account of how a poor little servant girl convicted of having stolen
[Line 503] some few clothes was dragged out half-dead with fear to a gibbet without the village and there slowly done to death before a crowd of people.  It was no unusual thing, for theft of over five shillings was punishable with death.  The record of our Courts in England is the most
[Line 504] brutal and most bloody in history.  They have been reformed but very partially.  There is still amongst Englishmen a vindictiveness towards the criminal that is unknown elsewhere.  Despite frequent denunciation of the uselessness and the wickedness of vindictive punishment, the idea continually recurs.  It is not merely excused--it is even counted as righteousness by those who maintain it. 
[Line 505] Now it would be impossible here to give a full analysis of the cause of this vindictiveness.  It has many causes.  It is not natural, but caused by education.  But a principal one lies in our theology.  A
[Line 506] theology that predicates a God who devotes poor mortals He made to
[Line 507] torture by fire for ever, simply for the fun of watching them suffer,
[Line 508] has elevated cruelty, uselessness, and vindictiveness into a divine
[Line 509] attribute.  Therefore men may be excused and even praised for imitating their God as far as in them lies.
[Line 510] The East is free from any such theology.  I am not an admirer of any of the theories at the base of its religions, but, at all events, none of them have sunk to such a depth as this.  Therefore the Oriental thought is free in this matter to discern the truth.
[Line 511]  And further, even the ordinary villagers are deeper psychologists than
[Line 512] we are.  How this comes about I am not sure; by the free life of the
[Line 513] children I think mainly.  But however it comes there is no doubt of the fact, for it has been widely noticed.  They are very quick at gauging
[Line 514] character, in weighing virtues and defects, at seeing in effects the causes.  Thus, all throughout the East the fatality that runs through
[Line 515] life has been seen; it has even passed into a saying.  By fatality, of
[Line 516] course, is not meant that God fore-ordains all events, but that every
[Line 517] act has its antecedent, that it never stands alone but is the outcome of the past.  There has been endless discussion in Europe on this question, but to the East the matter presents itself in very simple
[Line 518] guise.  No man has the choice of when he is born, into what sort of a
[Line 519] physique, of what parents or country.  Neither has he any control over how he is brought up, whether educated or not.  Thus he himself is to a very great extent a creature not of his own will but of what we may
[Line 520] call Fate.  He has, moreover, no control over his environment; he did
[Line 521] not make the laws, the customs, nor the religion, which surround him. Many of his acts are done under the authority of others--parents,
[Line 522] teachers, masters, government; others are the inevitable result of the
[Line 523] environment (which he did not make) acting on his personality (which he did not make).  There is also chance--as we call it; sudden temptation for instance.  Therefore his ability to exercise freewill in act is
[Line 524] small, and to hold him personally responsible for all his acts is absurd.  Especially is this the case with crime.  No one originally
[Line 525] wants to commit crime; if he fall into it, his "will" is not usually to
[Line 526] blame.  A famine will cause a great deal of crime; the criminals did not make the famine.  An unusual strain was put on them, and they were
[Line 527] not able to stand the strain.  Everyone is a potential criminal--given
[Line 528] the circumstances.  It is more than probable that everyone has at one
[Line 529] time or another committed some offence.  This is well known in the
[Line 530] East, for they think there a great deal more than is supposed.  They have not been educated not to think yet.  I have myself discussed this point with many Orientals, and I have found that this clear view of the causation of crime is not unusual.  Even if the matter has not been
[Line 531] thought out there is an instinctive differentiation between a criminal
[Line 532] and his crime.  They, as I have said before, hate crime, but that shrinking from the criminal so common with us is not so marked with them.  Thus they have long ago seen the futility of attributing crime to a
[Line 533] defect of the individual will; they know it is due to much deeper, wider causes.  They have also seen the very narrow limits within which punishment avails.  Therefore our punishments shock them by their cruelty.  Ordinary cattle are worth from twenty to fifty shillings a head, and they roam about the forest on the outskirts of the fields almost unguarded.  Yet the theft of one is punishable always with two
[Line 534] years' rigorous imprisonment; that is to say, the man is vindictively
[Line 535] and uselessly punished, is turned into a confirmed criminal and ruined
[Line 536] for life for failing at a momentary temptation.  I have known cases where a man was sentenced to ten years' penal servitude for stealing a
[Line 537] few rupees--a piece of savagery that the Court sought to justify by the
[Line 538] fact that the man had committed several previous petty thefts.  Of course, the reason of his repeated crime was the man's inability to
[Line 539] earn a livelihood and exercise self-control.  He should have been taught and helped--not sent to penal servitude.  So are the instincts of the people outraged.
[Line 540]  I wonder how many people there are in this world who have not committed
[Line 541] some criminal offence; few I should think, and those not the most
[Line 542] useful of mankind.  I have just been reading of Mark Twain's boyhood, and how, besides "borrowing" many articles, he and his friend "hooked" a boat, painted it red so that the owner should not recognise it, and kept it. 
[Line 543] For that in England a hundred years ago he could and probably would
[Line 544] have been hanged if caught.  In Burma to-day he _might_, after
[Line 545] conviction, be let off under the first offender sections, but he would
[Line 546] most probably be sent to a reformatory.  Yet who thinks the worse of
[Line 547] Mark Twain for it?  We think we have reformed our laws and made them common-sense, but we have not.  They are still wicked beyond computation.
[Line 548]  In _The Soul of a People_, and in I think every book since, I have
[Line 549] animadverted upon the uselessness and cruelty of our penal system. When a man has committed a crime, what do we do?  Find out the weakness which led to it and cure that weakness--turn him out a whole and
[Line 550] healthy man again?  No.  We make him worse.  We make a confirmed criminal of him.  Is that sense, to say nothing of humanity?  A man who has committed a theft is not past cure; a man who has been in gaol
[Line 551] generally is.  The people see this clearly enough--that in helping to
[Line 552] get a man convicted they are not improving matters for themselves.  The
[Line 553] offender will come out of gaol a more dangerous character to his village than when he went in.  For they go back to their village; they
[Line 554] are not thrown loose in a great city as in England.  If in England an offender on his release had to be accepted back into his community, the uselessness of our penal system would soon come home to the public.
[Line 555] But we have no communities now in England, only an amorphous herd of
[Line 556] voters.
[Line 557] All this, however, is clear enough to the East.  Therefore they often won't report their losses.  They would sooner submit to the small monetary loss than have it on their consciences that they have ruined a
[Line 558] man for life.  And all for what?  Not even to rescue what they have lost, for the bullock is usually dead and eaten, and no compensation is
[Line 559] ever given.
[Line 560] The quantity of reported crime in Burma is bad enough, but what would it be if all crimes were reported?  Double, I should think.  I have known innumerable cases in my own experience where no report was made even of serious offences for this reason.  One was a case of attempted
[Line 561] murder. 
[Line 562] Thus there is a great and dangerous gap between the people and the
[Line 563] Courts, and there is no way of bridging it.  In England also there is
[Line 564] that gap, but it is not so wide, and there are juries who can partly
[Line 565] bridge it.  In Burma, practically speaking, for Burmans trial by jury does not exist.  There is nothing between the accused and the rigid
[Line 566] injustice of the laws.  The judge and the magistrate are helpless; they
[Line 567] must follow the law or be pulled up by the High Court.  But a jury need not give its reasons; its future does not depend on the Appellate Court; it is independent, and therein lies its strength and its usefulness.  It is juries that put common sense into laws and Courts.
[Line 568]  Here is a case in point where Europeans were concerned.  There was a certain big firm, and one day it discovered that it had lost certain
[Line 569] sums of money--not very large.  It could not find out how the loss had
[Line 570] occurred; the partners inquired in secret, but could find no evidence.
[Line 571] However, they suspected their cashier.  They knew he was hard up; they
[Line 572] heard he had been gambling.  But they had no proof.  What did they do? Amend their system of accounts and supervision to prevent loss in the future?  No.  They laid a trap.  They put a large sum within their cashier's reach in such a way that it would seem he could take it--at any rate for a short time--with safety.  He took it, and they prosecuted him.  The case, I think, was clear, but to the astonishment
[Line 573] of the judge, the jury acquitted the cashier.  They gave no reasons, of
[Line 574] course, in Court.  They simply said "Not guilty," and there was an end;
[Line 575] but once out of Court they were not so silent.
[Line 576]  "Why did we acquit?  Because the firm laid a trap.  They deliberately tempted him, knowing him to be hard up.  He was not charged with taking
[Line 577] the first small sums, and in our belief he never took them.  Probably he took the last big sum.  But why?  Because they tempted him.  The
[Line 578] firm were accessory, they were abettors of the crime.  Of course we
[Line 579] acquitted." 
[Line 580] And I think the general common sense of the community was with them.
[Line 581] No one has a right to tempt to crime and prosecute if the crime occurs. But had accused been a Burman he would have got seven years without a
[Line 582] doubt.  The Englishman got justice, a Burman would have got only law.
[Line 583] The Burmans are not blind, do not suppose it; they see this difference
[Line 584] well enough. 
[Line 585] Nothing could demonstrate more conclusively how utterly out of touch
[Line 586] with the people the Courts are, how useless in preventing crime, than the fact that every year Government in despair prosecutes, and either
[Line 587] holds to heavy security, or sends to gaol with hard labour for from six months to two years (mainly two years), over two thousand persons who are not only not convicted of any offence, but _are not accused of any offence_.  The exact number in 1910 was 2143.
[Line 588]  This is done under the Preventive sections of the Criminal Procedure Code, and anything more unjust, more useless, more provocative of crime
[Line 589] than this misuse of the sections it is impossible to imagine.  The
[Line 590] legitimate use of these preventive sections is simple enough.  They are
[Line 591] to meet the case of the police hearing that a crime, say a robbery, is being planned, and that to prevent its occurring, the would-be
[Line 592] criminals may be called on by a magistrate to find security to be of
[Line 593] good behaviour.
[Line 594] But such cases are rare and the sections are misused.  There are
[Line 595] general circulars in force obliging magistrates and police to use these sections to their utmost.  When officers are on tour they are enjoined
[Line 596] to demand at each village they visit if there are any idle or doubtful characters about, and if so, to prosecute them.  Pressure is brought to
[Line 597] bear on headmen to produce such characters, and they do produce--everyone they have reason to dislike.
[Line 598]  The evidence is all hearsay.  Here is a summary:
[Line 599]  _Question by Police_: Do you know Accused?
[Line 600] _Answer by Headman_: Yes. 
[Line 601] _Q_.  What sort of character has he?
[Line 602] _Ans_.  A bad character.
[Line 603] _Q_.  What sort of bad character? 
[Line 604] _Ans_.  Well, when B.'s headcloth was missing last year, Accused was supposed to have taken it.  _Q_.  You therefore consider him a thief?
[Line 605] _Ans_.  Yes.
[Line 606]  Three such witnesses, and if Accused cannot find substantial security,
[Line 607] away he goes to hard labour for two years.  This has gone on for the
[Line 608] last twenty years.  In 1910 one judge has actually opened his eyes wide enough to see that it is a way of manufacturing criminals, and the High Court go so far as to have "misgivings."  But there it ends.  There are in Burma now probably 60,000 or more men who have been deliberately made into criminals by Government.  No wonder crime is bad. 
[Line 609] What is to be done?
[Line 610]  The Indian people have clamoured for trial by jury of their peers--that
[Line 611] is their fellow-countrymen--but it has always been refused.  Government does not say why--but the reason is well known--it is because it fears that juries would invariably acquit.  And that fear is probably
[Line 612] justified.  Judging from what assessors do I should say it was fully
[Line 613] justified.  They would acquit.  But does not this very fact indicate that the law and the people are at variance?  It most emphatically does not mean that the Orientals condone crime; it means that they think
[Line 614] that crime is now wrongly dealt with.  There was a period in England
[Line 615] when juries would not convict.  Why?  Because they condoned crime?  No,
[Line 616] but because the punishments were too brutal; and the law had to be
[Line 617] altered till their consciences were satisfied.  That was the way the old penal laws came to be amended.  When juries won't convict it is because their consciences are being outraged in some way.  Has any
[Line 618] attempt ever been made to discover in what way our Courts in India now
[Line 619] outrage the people's consciences?  Never to my knowledge.  There has been the fixed idea that our system is perfect, therefore blame the people.  "They must have Oriental minds which no one can understand."  The Indian Penal Code is the principal law relating to offences and punishments, but there are many minor laws and all are defective in the same way--that they have been framed out of some inner consciousness, and not out of practical knowledge. 
[Line 620] Take the Gambling Acts in Burma.  The Burmese are a cheerful people, and, like other cheerful human beings, they like their game of chance
[Line 621] sometimes.  When it becomes a public nuisance, of course it must be
[Line 622] checked, no one doubts that; but the Gambling Acts go much farther than
[Line 623] that.  The people have not a great variety of games, and their
[Line 624] principal card game is a sort of bank.  It can, of course, become a big gamble, but it can also be as innocent as penny loo.  Nevertheless, it is always illegal because there is a banker.  That is the way the Act is framed.  So if five or six villagers gather in the evening for a
[Line 625] game at penny loo they can be raided, tried, and fined or imprisoned. I had a Burmese subordinate magistrate once who was not only a very "energetic" officer but a very religious officer, and he determined to
[Line 626] stop all this "pernicious gambling" in his township.  He established a
[Line 627] "terror," so to speak.  He had censors everywhere, and if a schoolboy tossed another double or quits for a farthing, the law was after them.  I could not stop him because he had the law behind him, but every month
[Line 628] I sent for all his gambling cases on revision, and I quashed them all. There wasn't any Appellate Court behind me in those matters and I had a
[Line 629] free hand.  Finally, as he wouldn't take a hint, I got my too energetic
[Line 630] assistant transferred to other fields of usefulness.  It doesn't look well for Englishmen to play bridge and other games of cards for money in their Clubs and bungalows while the Burmese are totally debarred.  It smacks of self-righteousness.  A good deal of our
[Line 631] rule does that now, and it does not tend to make it popular.  In human affairs there are a time and a place for things, but in law there is
[Line 632] only the absolute.  Now the absolute is wrong.  And if there is one
[Line 633] quality above another that is detestable it is self-righteousness.  Our
[Line 634] laws tend to self-righteousness; our judges and officials are very liable to succumb to that tendency.  It is bad for a man to have to
[Line 635] deal continually with the seamy side of human nature; he can only keep
[Line 636] his mind sweet by continual touch with the other side.  But in India and Burma the ordinary official knows nothing of the other side.  He
[Line 637] has no dealing with the people except in an official capacity.  He knows nothing of their ordinary life, their work, or their amusements.
[Line 638] He does not take an interest in the staple industries of his villages,
[Line 639] nor in the amusements of the people.  Therefore he cannot see how bad the laws are because he judges them _a priori_ and not in relation to
[Line 640] their effects on the people.  The Indian Penal Code he knows, the
[Line 641] accused and the witnesses he does not know; the Village Act he knows, the village organism he is hopelessly ignorant of.  Therefore when
[Line 642] Government pass and enforce laws that do more harm than good he cannot
[Line 643] tell them what is wrong.  Naturally, he must believe nothing is wrong.
[Line 644]  Yet the whole Penal System of India is wrong.  It is very wrong indeed. I believe I could keep a district in greater quietness and peace if its Criminal Courts were abolished altogether and I were allowed to use the
[Line 645] village organism in its proper form for preventing crime.  For the essential truth in dealing with crime, as with disease, is that it can be prevented but can rarely be cured.  However, I do not mean to say that Criminal Courts, if they administered good laws and were
[Line 646] reasonably constituted, are bad things.  They will in time be to crime
[Line 647] what hospitals are to diseases: places where the sufferer goes to have
[Line 648] his illness diagnosed and cured so that he come out a clean man whom the community will be glad to welcome back.  That a man who has once
[Line 649] been in gaol is for ever a social leper is the strongest condemnation a
[Line 650] system of criminal justice could receive.
[Line 651]  As things are now the people hate the Courts; they hate the law, all of it.  It must not be supposed that, because I have pointed out only certain defects, all the rest is satisfactory.  That is very far from
[Line 652] being the case.  But my object is not to criticise the laws or Courts exhaustively.  I only want to dissipate the complacency that regards them as perfect and the people alone to be blameworthy.  There is no one who more dislikes pointing out deficiencies than I do.  If I could
[Line 653] I would never write anything but pleasant things.  But that is impossible.  An imminent danger hangs over our Indian Empire, and so
[Line 654] our own future and its can only be secured by facing the truth.  If Indian officials on the spot would open their eyes and see things as they are there would be no cause to write--but they will not.   
[Line 655] CHAPTER VII  THE CIVIL COURTS
[Line 656]  We come now to the Civil Courts, wherein all suits relating to
[Line 657] property, to inheritance, and to money are tried.  I have already referred to the archaic state in which, all over India, matters of marriage and inheritance remain; no change has taken place during our rule, nor could do so.  Except in Burma, all these matters
[Line 658] are connected with religion, and although people when in a progressive
[Line 659] state will themselves not hesitate to break through fetters of religion and custom, they will never allow a foreign Government to do so.  Our
[Line 660] Government interferes already in a great many matters it had better leave alone, and to lay a sacrilegious finger on domestic concerns would cause instant antagonism.  It is not our business.  Is Government
[Line 661] thus to intrude into the very home?  You can imagine the howl there would be, and rightly.  We must not touch them, and the people, disorganised as they are, cannot touch them; so there they remain.
[Line 662]  In a previous book I have referred to the Burmese law that no one may make a will, and to its effect in preventing Burmans building up a
[Line 663] business.  Moreover, the law of inheritance is so doubtful sometimes that when a rich Burman dies his estate usually goes into Court and, naturally, does not come out again.  This is very unsatisfactory, but
[Line 664] until there is some real self-government I see no help for it.  On a
[Line 665] matter of this kind it is of no use collecting the opinions of any number of Burmans as to what should be done, and so passing an Act.  It is a fact to which I shall have to revert later that men as individuals
[Line 666] will give an opinion, which if combined into an assembly with authority to act they would greatly modify.  Moreover, if our Government were
[Line 667] responsible, individuals would urge action, which if they themselves
[Line 668] were responsible they would not take.  No advice that is not steadied
[Line 669] by a sense of responsibility is of much value.  Our Government cannot
[Line 670] deal with such matters.  Only a body representing Burmese opinion and responsible to that opinion could do it.  There is not now any prospect
[Line 671] of any such body.  The present Councils are useless.  There may be such
[Line 672] a body in course of time, but until there is, matters must remain as they are.  The result is discontent, naturally.
[Line 673] Take another similar point.  In Upper Burma a good deal of the land is
[Line 674] what is called ancestral land; that is to say, in private hands.  Now there was amongst the people a great pride in holding land their ancestors held, and such land is very rarely sold.  I am not quite sure
[Line 675] that it can be sold.  Neither is it mortgaged in the usual sense.  What the owner does is to hand the land over to a mortgagee for a sum of
[Line 676] money.  He pays no interest on the debt because the mortgagee enjoys
[Line 677] the land.  Such a transaction is called a usufructuary mortgage.  The
[Line 678] owner can at any time redeem the land by repaying the original loan.
[Line 679] In Burmese time there was no period of limitation, but our Limitation Act has imposed a limit of sixty years.  Thus a man may hand over a piece of land to a mortgagee, go off to Lower Burma--as many have--and
[Line 680] at any time within sixty years he or his heirs can redeem the land for
[Line 681] the same sum.  Consider what this means.  I am the mortgagee of a piece of land.  If I
[Line 682] improve it so that its value is increased the owner can come back, borrow money to redeem it, and re-mortgage it for double the amount
[Line 683] next day to someone else.  Therefore I certainly won't improve it.  I
[Line 684] can't sell it.  I can work it of course.  I have also to defend my
[Line 685] title every now and then from attack.  It may be that the original mortgagor did not own the land at all.  He may have simply been the
[Line 686] member of the family in whom the occupation was vested.  The other
[Line 687] members can challenge my right.  They do.  And this sort of thing can
[Line 688] go on for sixty years.  That is not the sort of law to encourage progress.  It encourages litigation, but that is all.  The whole
[Line 689] country groans under it naturally.  But before any relief could be
[Line 690] given there would have to be some consensus of opinion among the people as to the change.  Government could not do it themselves.  Even if their amendment were good it would raise a hornets' nest about their
[Line 691] ears.  Thus here again is an _impasse_, and a dangerous one, typical of many.  By our system of Civil Law and Civil Courts, of precedent and case law
[Line 692] we have petrified the bonds in which India lay when we arrived and made them far more rigid than before.  While by our introduction of new
[Line 693] ideas and of greater material progress we have rendered the old laws
[Line 694] more and more obsolete, we have at the same time stopped all evolution of these laws, and killed any capacity they had for accommodating themselves to change.  Some lawyers even, enthusiastic as they are
[Line 695] about their own profession, have seen this danger.  Here is what Sir
[Line 696] Henry Sumner Maine, who was Legal Member to the Government of India, says:
[Line 697]  "What that law and usage"--Indian law and usage--"was, the Sudder Court
[Line 698] used to ascertain with what some would call most conscientious accuracy and others the most technical narrowness.  Under the hand of the Judges of the Sudder Courts the native rules hardened and contracted a rigidity which they never had in real native practice.  Among the older
[Line 699] records of their proceedings may be found injunctions couched in the
[Line 700] technical language of English Chancery proceedings which forbid the priests of a particular temple to injure a rival fane by painting the
[Line 701] face of their idol red instead of yellow, and decrees allowing the
[Line 702] complaint of other priests that they were injured in property and repute because their neighbours rang a bell at a particular moment of their services.  There is in truth but little doubt that until
[Line 703] education began to cause the natives of India to absorb Western ideas for themselves the influence of the English rather retarded than
[Line 704] hastened the mental development of the race."  And it does so more and more, because however much they may absorb Western ideas theoretically, they cannot express them practically owing to our petrifaction of their law and custom. 
[Line 705] Again.  "The methods of interpretation which the Sudder Courts borrowed from the Supreme Courts imported from Westminster Hall put a stop to any natural growth and improvement of Hindu law."
[Line 706] That is to say we introduced new ideas, but sat on the safety-valve lest they should produce any effect.  Sir Henry Sumner Maine's book is full of similar expressions, but I need quote no more.  Those who wish to read how a lawyer himself has admitted this failure of law will no
[Line 707] doubt read the book for themselves. 
[Line 708] And now let us go on to the other functions of the Civil Courts--money
[Line 709] decrees and so forth.  I do not think that they are any more in touch with the public than the
[Line 710] Criminal Courts.
[Line 711] To begin with, they suffer from the same defect that a trial before a Civil Court is not an inquiry into truth, but a duel between parties. Indeed this is even more manifest than in the Criminal Courts, for there the magistrate does to the best of his small ability go outside
[Line 712] the record and try to ascertain facts for himself; in the Civil Courts
[Line 713] the judge never does so.  He is simply and purely an umpire.  Has the
[Line 714] plaintiff proved his case?  If so, give him a decree; if not, then not.
[Line 715] Therefore perjury, and even forgery, are more common here than in the
[Line 716] Criminal Courts.
[Line 717]  Now let us go back to the way suits originate, and see what the cause
[Line 718] is.
[Line 719] There are, of course, a few cases where the issue is clear from the
[Line 720] first.  A dies.  B and C both claim his inheritance.  Here from the beginning is a clear issue which can be brought into Court and fought out.  It must come into Court, because in no other way could it be
[Line 721] settled.  But there are few such suits.  In the great majority of cases
[Line 722] the original issue is quite a small one, but when it comes into Court it is, by one side or the other, or both, swollen out of all
[Line 723] recognition.  Take the following as an example.  It is from a case I heard once.
[Line 724] A and B were both natives of India--Hindus--and had been partners.  I
[Line 725] cannot remember their business beyond that they bought articles in
[Line 726] Upper India and imported them into Upper Burma, where they sold them. It was a small business.  One partner would go to India, buy stock, and return with it to Burma.  They would both trade in it, and when it was nearly done one of them would go away to India again.  This had gone on for some years.  They agreed together excellently and made a decent
[Line 727] profit.  They kept all their accounts in their heads, aided by an
[Line 728] occasional scrap of memoranda, and made a settlement from time to time.
[Line 729] Then they would begin afresh.
[Line 730]  At last came a disagreement.  When A returned to Burma with a new stock, B objected to the price paid for one item, alleging that A had been "done," and had paid too much.
[Line 731] A indignantly repelled this accusation.  B stood to his guns.  The item was only about five hundred rupees, and the difference was not more
[Line 732] than twenty or thirty rupees, but neither would give way.  The quarrel grew.  B said he would not share in the item; A said he
[Line 733] must, as it was a partnership transaction.  B said he didn't care.  A
[Line 734] said he would sue him in Court.  B said, "Very well, sue me."  So each
[Line 735] went off to get a pleader.
[Line 736] In due time the case came into Court, but what a case!  Each side had considered that if he had got to fight he had better get all the weapons he could, so he raked up everything he could think of.  It was a duel, you see, wherein each side fought not to settle the little
[Line 737] point at issue, but for victory--any kind of victory he could get. Each side stirred up every sleeping dog of war he could find, resuscitated and galvanised dead dogs, made up imitation dogs, and came to battle.
[Line 738] The issues finally framed covered several years' transactions, and the
[Line 739] evidence included forged documents and quantities of perjury.  Both sides were ruined.  That is what comes of making a trial a duel.  Each side fights for
[Line 740] victory, to save his _amour propre_, and to wound the enemy wherever he
[Line 741] can.  The original cause of difference is quite lost.
[Line 742] Now that case is typical of many.  It is illustrative of human nature all the world over.  If you awake the fighting instinct you cannot
[Line 743] confine the parties to the original seat of war; they will urge the attack wherever they are likely to win.  They cannot go to the judge in
[Line 744] the beginning as to a friend of both parties who will inquire into the cause of difference himself and find a reasonable settlement, because
[Line 745] judges are not intended to do that.  Therefore parties do not go to Court at all until they have determined to fight it out.  The case does
[Line 746] not come to Court till matters are hopeless.
[Line 747]  You may say they should or could have gone to an arbitrator.  Do people
[Line 748] anywhere in the world trust an unofficial arbitrator?  There is a provision in Upper Burma allowing reference to arbitration, but it is a
[Line 749] dead letter. 
[Line 750] The original dispute in this case was about twenty or thirty rupees,
[Line 751] the alleged excess paid for the goods.  The suit filed was for several
[Line 752] thousand rupees in transactions spread over years: there was an equally heavy counterclaim.
[Line 753]  The total value of the suits filed in Burma in 1910 was about £1,380,000.  I wonder what the value was of the matters first in dispute before the cases came to Court.  A fifth, I dare say, would
[Line 754] cover them.  I notice much the same thing in England.  Human nature does not differ East or West.
[Line 755]  Now consider the enormous expense of all this.  The value of the
[Line 756] subject-matter of suits filed in Burma in 1910 was, as I have said,
[Line 757] £1,380,000.  The value of the matters really in dispute before they came to Court was infinitely less, but Court fees and lawyers' fees had to be paid on the full amount.  Witnesses in thousands were called to prove matters that should never have come into Court at all.
[Line 758] And with what result?  There were 70,203 suits filed and decrees given, but in 53,594 of these satisfaction could not be obtained, and so the decree-holders had to
[Line 759] come to Court for warrants for execution.  That is to say that in over
[Line 760] five suits out of seven the losing party could not or would not pay. (It does not follow that in the other two out of the seven he did pay.
[Line 761] The decree-holder in a percentage of cases no doubt did not think it
[Line 762] worth while to go any further.)
[Line 763]  But in 53,594 cases he came to Court for execution.  What did he get?
[Line 764] In half these cases he got absolutely nothing; the execution was "wholly infructuous."  In the other cases satisfaction was obtained in full or in part. 
[Line 765] Thus out of £1,380,000 claimed how much was obtained?  The Report does
[Line 766] not give figures, but the reader can judge for himself it wasn't much. And to get even this little, what was the cost to the litigants, that
[Line 767] is the public?  No one knows.  But there are a great many lawyers of
[Line 768] kinds in Burma, and a good deal of money goes into their hands. 
[Line 769] I do not think it would be an over-estimate to say that for every pound originally in dispute two pounds were spent in costs and only ten
[Line 770] shillings recovered, and to get this, think of the trouble, the worry,
[Line 771] the indignity, and the self-contempt involved.  Besides, think of the waste of time--to say nothing of truth.
[Line 772] In the Report from which I take these figures the Judges of the High
[Line 773] Court point out that the Courts are yearly becoming less and less used by the public.  They can't think how this can be; but they suppose it
[Line 774] is due to years of prosperity.  That it should be due to anything wrong
[Line 775] about the Courts never occurs to them.  Yet perhaps the reader will see reason to doubt if the system of Civil Justice is perfect.  There is an Indian proverb that it is wise to go to law once, foolish to go twice.  I asked an Indian about this.
[Line 776]  "Why is it wise to go once?" I asked.  "Because," he answered, "you learn a great deal, quite a great deal,
[Line 777] which you never forget.  You learn, anyhow, not to go twice." 
[Line 778] "But," I objected, "suppose on a subsequent occasion money were due to
[Line 779] you which you couldn't get, would you sit down under the loss?"
[Line 780]  He looked at me and laughed.  "Well," he said, "if it were a small debt
[Line 781] I should let it go.  If I thought the man could not pay I would let it
[Line 782] go, big or little; but if I thought he could pay and wouldn't, I wouldn't sue him; no, but I wouldn't put up with him either."
[Line 783]  "What then would you do?" 
[Line 784] "Well," he answered reflectively, "I think I should rob him."
[Line 785] "But that might bring you into a Criminal Court," I remonstrated.
[Line 786] "So it might," he replied; "but the Criminal Courts can't be worse than the Civil; and, anyhow, it would be a change."
[Line 787]  As to the Insolvent side of the Civil Courts, perhaps if I say that it is no nearer the people than any other side, enough will have been said, and later on I shall have a story to tell of some of my
[Line 788] experiences, but this is not the place.  What is gained by imprisoning a man for debt?  Nothing that I ever heard of.  It is not required to deter him from being ruined again; he probably won't get the chance, and if he did the fact of having been
[Line 789] sold up once is quite sufficient deterrent from wanting to be sold up
[Line 790] again.
[Line 791] Will it deter others?  People don't get ruined for the fun of the
[Line 792] thing.  It is a dreadful thing to be sold up; in itself that is quite
[Line 793] enough.  Then what good does imprisoning the poor devil do?  It does none.  It does harm, and nothing but harm.  It hurts the debtor and prevents his recovering himself; it panders to the desire of society and of creditors for revenge.  There is an idea abroad that when anything untoward happens somebody should be punished, and then society will have vindicated itself.  But the duty of society is to prevent crime, not punish it, and it cannot whitewash itself in this way.  It
[Line 794] merely condemns itself more even than it condemns him it punishes.  Moreover, the ability of creditors to imprison debtors is misused in a
[Line 795] way that is almost criminal.  The creditor will imprison the debtor
[Line 796] with the hope that the debtor's relatives and friends will subscribe to save him and them from this disgrace.  That is to say, the law allows a
[Line 797] creditor to put improper pressure on totally innocent people in order
[Line 798] to get his claims satisfied.  Think of the iniquity of a law like that!
[Line 799] And what are these claims?  Are they just claims?  They are legal claims, but are they just?
[Line 800]  For the most part they are claims of money-lenders.  The Courts act as collecting agencies to the most oppressive system of money-lending that can be imagined.  Two and a half per-cent per month is not unusual.
[Line 801]  Government has shown its recognition of this danger by creating Co-operative Credit Banks, which are a great boon.  But it has not thought of revising its Civil Court procedure.  As in most other
[Line 802] matters, it recognises something wrong, but attributes it to the people, not to the Courts and the law; therefore it does nothing. 
[Line 803] But at all events imprisonment for debt should be abolished.  There were eight hundred unfortunate debtors imprisoned in Burma in 1910.
[Line 804] Do you wonder that the people dread and hate the Courts?
[Line 805] Civil law embraces a great variety of suits besides suits for money, and includes a great number of special laws.  The harm that has been
[Line 806] done by fossilising Hindu, Mohammedan, and Buddhist law and custom has
[Line 807] been already mentioned; to enter further into these matters is unnecessary.  Once it is clearly recognised that the law and the Courts require amendment, not in details but in fundamental principles, there
[Line 808] will be many better critics than I am.  For although I have been
[Line 809] obliged to learn some law in order to do my work, I was never an apt student of it.  Humanity and justice are the only studies I really care for.  Law is mainly a denial of both.  Therefore if the Government of
[Line 810] India and the local officials will but give up thinking that where law and human nature disagree it is so much the worse for human nature, they will soon find out where the present laws are wrong.  But before I
[Line 811] close this chapter there is one further point I wish to mention, and
[Line 812] that is the trial of Burmese divorce suits by our Courts.  Now that is
[Line 813] wrong, absolutely wrong, and indefensible in every way.  The Courts are not concerned with divorce.  It is by Burmese custom and common sense a purely village matter.  Divorces can be given by the elders, and they
[Line 814] alone should be allowed to pronounce them.  For they are sensible men, and in such cases they act not as judges, but as neighbours.  They will grant no divorce till they have exhausted all means of conciliation.
[Line 815] They know the parties as no judge can know them; they know who is to
[Line 816] blame, how he or she is to blame, how the difference can be adjusted.
[Line 817] It is to their interest to smooth things down and prevent their getting
[Line 818] worse.  Theoretically the breakers of marriages, they are in fact the
[Line 819] preservers of marriage.  It is by their tact and common sense that
[Line 820] couples are kept together, and that only when matters become impossible
[Line 821] divorces are granted.  But a judge is different.  He knows nothing, cares nothing, can do
[Line 822] nothing but listen to the complaint and grant the divorce.  It must
[Line 823] legally be granted at the request of either party, remember.  To allow a judge to try divorce cases is a violation of Burmese law and custom,
[Line 824] and is another and deep injury to the village community.  How and why
[Line 825] it was ever allowed I don't know.  I suppose no one ever thought about
[Line 826] it.  Divorces in England are granted by Courts according to English
[Line 827] law, therefore in Burma divorces can be granted according to Burmese law.  I suppose that was the argument--if ever there was any argument at all.  In any case it is wrong.  Divorces are properly granted by the elders
[Line 828] acting on behalf of the community, and by no one else.  Therefore the interference of the Courts should be immediately stopped. 
[Line 829] But apart from this, the questions of marriage and inheritance are very
[Line 830] difficult.  No alien Government can solve them.  They must await a real
[Line 831] Council that can deal with such matters with knowledge and
[Line 832] responsibility. 
[Line 833]   
[Line 834] CHAPTER VIII 
[Line 835] THE VILLAGE  But of all the errors of Indian government, none is so serious as their
[Line 836] destruction of the Village organism throughout India; none has had such
[Line 837] an effect in the past; none is likely to have such bad consequences in the future.
[Line 838]  It is the Village policy of government that has created for it the most difficulties, and which is at the bottom of the most serious unrest. For it touches not merely a few as criminal law, but practically all the population; it affects not only a part of the life of India, but it has injured it in its most vital point.  In the whole history of
[Line 839] administration there is nothing I think so demonstrative of the ignorance of government as the Village policy.  The foundation on which not only all government but all civilisation
[Line 840] rests throughout the world is the village.  As this is contrary to the
[Line 841] usual idea that civilisation rests on the family it will be convenient to shortly show how this is so.  The village is the microcosm of the
[Line 842] State, because it includes within it divers trades and occupations and races and religions and castes in one community.  A family does not do so.  A family is by its nature of one blood, it is almost always of one
[Line 843] occupation.  There are families of cultivators, merchants, priests, lawyers, smiths, and so on.  It is of one religion, of one caste, of one habit of thought.  A family is narrow and a village is broad.
[Line 844] Families divide; villages combine.  Societies organised on the family, or clan, or tribe principle have always failed--by the very nature of
[Line 845] things they must so fail.  The Jews are a race, or tribe, and not a nation.  They have no civilisation of their own, but adopt that in
[Line 846] which they live.  The Highland clans had to be broken before the Highlands could be civilised.  The caste system in India ruined its old civilisation, and is the bar to any new civilisation.  The Turkish
[Line 847] Empire is dead because it was based on a religious caste divided from
[Line 848] all others by a mutilation, and its people could never amalgamate with
[Line 849] others.  There is a continual flow of peoples to and fro upon the earth, and village communities absorb the new-comers and thereby
[Line 850] acquire new blood, and, what is far more important, new ideas, to add
[Line 851] to the old and leaven them.  Families, classes and tribes cannot do this.  They become stereotyped, and dissolve or die.  Thus the basis of
[Line 852] all civilisation has been the village, or in later times the town.  The decay and death of all civilisations have been preceded by the death of the local unit.  Thus imperial Rome was itself doomed to death when it
[Line 853] destroyed local life; and a new civilisation could not be built up till the local communities had attained a fresh life.  Florence, Genoa,
[Line 854] Milan, Pisa, Venice, and many others made the civilisation of the
[Line 855] Renaissance.  So in England, a free Parliament was made up of
[Line 856] representatives from free cities and counties.  These have been destroyed, and the present constituencies are merely so many voters. Policies are no longer decided in Parliament, but in secret party conclave.  Members are the nominees of that conclave, not of free local organisms, and Parliament has become a machine to register its decrees.
[Line 857] So are free institutions passing away. 
[Line 858] There is no lesson of history more true--more certain--than this, that
[Line 859] the village or town is the unit of all free life and civilisation.  It
[Line 860] contains all classes, different races, religions, castes and forms of
[Line 861] thought, and is therefore a real unit.  Now these units have existed all over the world, and when civilisations and governments have disappeared they have been built up anew from the villages.  In India the village system was the one organism that
[Line 862] survived the long years of anarchy and invasion, and it was in full
[Line 863] vigour when we conquered India.  Those who care to read up the subject
[Line 864] can see it in Sir Henry Sumner Maine's _Indian Village Communities_.
[Line 865] In Upper Burma, on its annexation in 1885, the village community was strong and healthy; it alone survived the fall of King Thibaw's Government.  Then we deliberately destroyed it, as we had destroyed it before all through India. 
[Line 866] Now this is an instructive and interesting fact, for it was destroyed in ignorance, not by _malice prepense_. 
[Line 867] Throughout India--and especially in Burma--you will find Government
[Line 868] reiterating its conviction of the importance of preserving the village organism, repeating the conviction of its absolute necessity, and at
[Line 869] the same time killing it.  This is but an instance of much of the action of Government.  It means well; it does actually see the end to
[Line 870] be attained--it has no idea how to attain that end; but, instead, it
[Line 871] renders it impossible. 
[Line 872] If I explain what happened in Burma, the history, _mutatis mutandis_,
[Line 873] of what has occurred throughout India will be clear. 
[Line 874] In the first place, a "village" does not mean only one collection of houses; it is a territorial unit of from one to a hundred square miles.
[Line 875] Originally, of course, there was in each unit one hamlet; but, as
[Line 876] population grew, daughter hamlets were thrown off.  They still,
[Line 877] however, remained under the jurisdiction of the mother hamlet, and they all together formed one village.  In each village there were a Headman
[Line 878] and a Council of Elders.  The headman was appointed or rather approved by the Burmese Government for life or good behaviour; the council was
[Line 879] not recognised by law.  Notwithstanding this, the council was the real power.  It was not formally elected, it had no legal standing, but it
[Line 880] was the real power.  The headman was only its representative and not
[Line 881] its master; he was but _primus inter pares_.
[Line 882]  This headman and council ruled all village matters.  They settled the
[Line 883] house sites, the rights of way, the marriage of boys and girls,
[Line 884] divorces, public manners; they put up such public works as were done, they divided the tax amongst the inhabitants according to their means, and were collectively responsible for the whole.  There was hardly any
[Line 885] appeal from their decision, but the power not being localised in an individual but in a council of all the elders, things went well.  The
[Line 886] village was a real living organism, within which people learned to act
[Line 887] together, to bear and forbear; there were a local patriotism and a
[Line 888] local pride.  Within it lay the germ of unlimited progress.
[Line 889] The English Government on taking over Upper Burma recognised the extreme value of this organisation.  In Lower Burma much of our difficulty arose from the fact that the organisation was wanting and
[Line 890] that between Government and the individual there was no one.  So one of the first efforts of Government in Upper Burma was to endeavour to
[Line 891] preserve and strengthen this local self-government.  Unfortunately
[Line 892] every effort it made resulted in destroying it rather than consolidating it.  A wrong view was taken from the beginning.
[Line 893] The council was ignored.  How this happened I do not know, I can only
[Line 894] suppose that it arose from ignorance.  The only man recognised by the Burmese Government we replaced was the headman.  They dealt directly
[Line 895] with him and not with the council.  They did not appoint the council or
[Line 896] regulate it in any way.  In law no council existed.  Therefore, when we took over, the law was mistaken for the fact--a common mistake, due to
[Line 897] seeking for knowledge in papers, and not in life--and the council was ignored.  The following seems to have been the argument: Government appointed the headman, therefore he was an official.  Government did not appoint or recognise any council, therefore there was no council.
[Line 898] Anyhow, that was the decision arrived at and enforced.  There is on record a circular of the Local Government in which the
[Line 899] headman of a village is described as a Government official; to be to his village what the District Officer is to his district.  That is
[Line 900] disastrous.  A headman is not an official of the Government.  His whole value and meaning is that he is a representative of the people before Government.  He expresses the collective views of the village and receives the orders of Government for them as a whole.  He is _their_
[Line 901] head, not a finger of Government.  He corresponded almost exactly to
[Line 902] the mayor of an English town, who would be insulted if you called him a
[Line 903] Government official.  Yet this mistaken view was taken of the village
[Line 904] headman, and this error has vitiated all dealings of Government with the village organisation and its headman.  He is appointed by
[Line 905] Government instead of being appointed by the people and approved by
[Line 906] Government.  He is responsible to Government, not to his village--as he ought to be--for the use or abuse of his powers.  He is punished by
[Line 907] Government for laxity.  By the Village Regulation he can be fined by the District Officer.  There has grown up among Europeans in the East a custom of imposing fines.  They fine their servants for breakages and innumerable other small matters, and then complain how scarce good servants are.  The clerks in Government offices used to be subject to continual fines until Lord Curzon stopped it.  Now headmen of villages can be fined by the District Officer; and they are fined; the proviso is no dead
[Line 908] letter.  It is a mark of the "energetic" officer to use it.  Can there
[Line 909] be anything more destructive?  Imagine the headman, the mayor of a community of three or four thousand people, fined five shillings for
[Line 910] the delay of a return, or set, like a schoolboy, to learn a code--with
[Line 911] the clerks.  I have seen this done often.  What respect for Government,
[Line 912] what from his own people, what self-respect, can he retain after such treatment?  Again, by ignoring the council and making the headman an official,
[Line 913] Government set up a number of petty tyrants in the villages, free from all control but its own; consequently it has been forced to allow great
[Line 914] latitude of appeal.  This still further destroys his authority.  He is under old custom, legalised by the Village Regulation, empowered to punish his villagers who disobey him in certain matters.  The
[Line 915] punishments are, of course, trivial.  When approved by the council, as in old days, they were final; but now they can be appealed against--and are.  A headman who endeavours to enforce his authority runs the risk
[Line 916] of being complained against and forced to attend Headquarters, to waste days of valuable time and considerable sums of money to defend himself for having fined a villager a shilling for not mending his fence.  One
[Line 917] or two experiences of this sort and the headman lets things slide in future.
[Line 918]  Thus interference with the village is constant and disastrous.  Headmen
[Line 919] are bullied, fined, set to learn lessons like children, all in the name
[Line 920] of efficiency.  And Government wonders why the village system decays.
[Line 921] A continual complaint of Government is that headmen are no longer the men they used to be, that they have lost authority.  The best men will not take the appointment--and who can wonder?  Here is a story in illustration:
[Line 922] There was a small village in my district, on a main road, and the headman died.  It was necessary to appoint a new one.  But no one would take the appointment.  The elders were asked to nominate a man, but no one would take the nomination.  I sent the Township Officer to try to arrange; he failed.
[Line 923] Now a village cannot get along without a headman.  Government is at an end; no taxes can be collected, for instance; therefore it was
[Line 924] necessary a headman be appointed at once.  I went to the village myself and called the elders and gave them an order that they must nominate someone.  So next morning, after stormy meetings in the village, a man was brought to me and introduced as the headman-elect.  He was dirty, ill-clad, and not at all the sort of man I should have cared to appoint, nor one whom it would be supposed the villagers would care to
[Line 925] accept.  Yet he was the only nominee. 
[Line 926] "What is your occupation?" I asked.
[Line 927] He said he had none.
[Line 928] "What tax did you pay last year?"  I asked him this in order to
[Line 929] discover his standing, for men are rated according to their means.  He told me that he had paid five shillings--less than a third of the average.  "You are willing to be headman?" I asked. 
[Line 930] "No," he said frankly.  "But no one would take the place, and the elders told me I must.  They said they would prosecute me under the
[Line 931] 'bad livelihood' section if I didn't.  I could take my choice between being headman or a term in prison." 
[Line 932] This was, of course, an extreme case, but it illustrates the position. The headman is degraded and all administration suffers.
[Line 933]  It is the same in municipalities.  The work is done by the District
[Line 934] Officer because it is easier for him to do it than to instruct and allow others to do it.
[Line 935]  The people one and all hate this.  The headman hates it, because though
[Line 936] he is given much greater power nominally than he used to have he dare
[Line 937] not use this power.  He is isolated from his villagers, and so often becomes an object of dislike to them.  Through him orders are enforced which are not liked by the people, and he has to bear all the brunt. His dignity is gone.  Sometimes he is murdered.  The elders hate it.  They have been ignored.  They are placed under a
[Line 938] headman who may or may not attend to what they say.  They have lost all
[Line 939] interest--because all power--in their village affairs.  They have no
[Line 940] responsibility. 
[Line 941] The villagers hate it.  A council of their own elders they could
[Line 942] respect and submit to; a one-man rule they detest.  Their appeal to the council on the spot (who know) has been lost; and in place of it they have an appeal to a distant officer who, with the best will in the
[Line 943] world, cannot know.  An appeal costs money, and even to win may be to lose.  They all want to manage their affairs; they can do it far better
[Line 944] than we can, and there is nothing they so much appreciate as being
[Line 945] allowed to do so.  Here is how I learnt this:  Some eighteen years ago I was leaving a station where I had been for a
[Line 946] year as subordinate officer, and had to cross the river by launch to the steamer station on the other shore.  I went down to the bank to get the launch, but it was late.  I saw it three miles away, and so sat
[Line 947] down under a tree to wait. 
[Line 948] Presently two or three elderly Burmans came and sat down near me.  Then
[Line 949] came others, till maybe twenty elderly men were there.  I recognised
[Line 950] two or three vaguely, but none clearly.  I wondered at their being there, and asked:
[Line 951] "Are you crossing over too?" 
[Line 952] They shook their heads.
[Line 953] "What are you here for, then?" 
[Line 954] They looked embarrassed, and at last one spoke.  "We came to say
[Line 955] 'Good-bye' to you."
[Line 956]  I stared.  "But I do not know you, except that I suppose you are elders
[Line 957] of the town."  "We are," they said, "and you do not know us because you have not ever worried us in any way.  When we had business together you did it quickly and decisively; otherwise you left us alone.  You did not treat us as children.  Therefore we are sorry you are going."
[Line 958] I laughed.  I could not help it.  To come and express regret at a man's leaving on the ground that they knew next to nothing of him and did not
[Line 959] want to know more seemed unusual.  But it was true.  And often, after, did I think over that "send-off" and take the lesson to heart.
[Line 960] Now what is true in Burma is true over all India.  The local circumstances of course vary.  A lumbadar in the North-West, for
[Line 961] instance, does not quite correspond to a headman in Burma.  The actual form in which the village was organised differs from place to place
[Line 962] according to local needs.  Even in Burma it differed a good deal.  But
[Line 963] the differences were only of form.  In all India there were self-contained village communities within which, to a certain extent,
[Line 964] caste, religion, and race were subordinated to local communal feeling.
[Line 965] And everywhere Government has killed it by turning the village
[Line 966] officials into Government officials, responsible to Government and not
[Line 967] to the village. 
[Line 968] Thus there is now absolutely no organism a man can belong to.  There
[Line 969] are three hundred and fifty million individuals in India, and that is
[Line 970] all.  They are divided laterally into strata by caste and religion, and
[Line 971] there is no influence to draw them together.  All organised life is dead.  Government by means of its official--the headman--interferes
[Line 972] with almost every detail of life, regulating his conduct by rules drawn
[Line 973] up in Secretariats by men who never knew what a village was, and the appeal is to another alien officer.
[Line 974] Further, all morality and all conduct are the outcome of corporate life, that is to say, of the village or of a larger unit.  Morality is,
[Line 975] in fact, where it is useful and true, the knowledge of how to get along with your fellow men and women, what conduct offends them and leads to
[Line 976] the injury of society, what pleases them and tends to harmony and mutual happiness.  It is not fixed, but adapts itself to changing circumstances of the society, and it is enforced by the opinion of that
[Line 977] society. 
[Line 978] But injure the society and both manners and morals are shaken.  It is a
[Line 979] common complaint of India to-day that the bonds of morality have
[Line 980] greatly slackened and that manners have almost disappeared.  This is attributed to the waning influence of religions.  But, generally speaking, religions have not waned in India--on the contrary, their influences have increased.  The people have become more and more in the power of religious systems.  Therefore the cause given is absurd and
[Line 981] untrue.  It does not exist.  Further, neither morality nor manners are
[Line 982] the outcome of religion.  On the contrary.  Religions claim them to be so, but the claim is false.  Manners and morals may be said to be the gravity which binds individuals into a community.  They make the
[Line 983] community and are themselves the outcome of the community.  Destroy the
[Line 984] community and you have destroyed the source from which manners and
[Line 985] morals arise.  That has been done all through India.  In another book I have pointed out how disastrously this has acted in Burma and how much the people
[Line 986] feel it.  I do not want to repeat myself.  But if those officials who deplore the frequent cases of young girls running away with boys, of seduction, of adultery and other offences, of immature marriages, and
[Line 987] other mistakes, would but realise that all these arise from the injury
[Line 988] we have caused to society, there might be a change.  All the human virtues, with no exception, either arise from or are increased by the aggregation of men into communities, and it is very difficult to keep them alive where no organic communities exist.  Consider the words humanity, civilisation, patriotism, urbanity--their derivations and their meanings--and you will see this.  I do not think I need say more.  I have tried to set out the facts as clearly and dispassionately as I can.  I have omitted much that I might have said.  I have tried here, as throughout, to understate
[Line 989] difficulties rather than exaggerate them, because exaggeration defeats
[Line 990] its own ends.  But I think if the reader will try to realise to himself the state of affairs where no village has a say even in its simplest affairs, and where everything is under the eye of a Government official, where all initiative is forbidden and where the best men stand aloof from all interest in village affairs, he will have some idea that unrest is not unreasonable. 
[Line 991] The village organism was the one vital institution left to India; it was the one germ of corporate life that could have been encouraged into a larger growth.  It has been killed.  It will have to be resuscitated
[Line 992] before India can cease to be _India Irredenta_.
[Line 993]   
[Line 994] CHAPTER IX
[Line 995]  OPIUM AND EXCISE
[Line 996]  I will begin what I have to say about this by telling a little story
[Line 997] about what happened to me when I was a Subordinate Magistrate--some sixteen years ago now. 
[Line 998] A Burman was brought up before me charged with possessing opium.  A Sergeant of Police had met him at a rest-house in the jungle the day before, and had entered into conversation.  The man was sickly and told
[Line 999] the Sergeant that he was on his way down from the Shan States, where he had gone to trade.  But he had caught the prevalent fever, had then lain ill and lost his money.  So he was going home again to his village
[Line 1000] about fifty miles away, where he hoped to recover his health. Meanwhile he took a little opium for the fever, for in the Shan States opium is not contraband. 
[Line 1001] "Oh, you have opium?" asked the Sergeant.
[Line 1002] "I brought some down with me," the man said, producing it.  Then the Sergeant, as in duty bound, arrested him and brought him into Court.
[Line 1003]  The case was quite clear.  The man admitted the opium, urged that he
[Line 1004] was ill, also that he did not know--neither of which is a defence in
[Line 1005] law--and I passed the smallest sentence that I thought the High Court
[Line 1006] would allow to pass without a reprimand.  I fined him ten rupees or in
[Line 1007] default ten days' imprisonment.  Then I went on to other cases and
[Line 1008] forgot about it.  At four o'clock I left the bench and went to my
[Line 1009] private room to sign papers before leaving Court.  There was a pile of
[Line 1010] them.  I signed, the peon pulled away; I signed again, he pulled; and so on till I looked up.  There in the doorway stood the Sergeant.  He seemed embarrassed.  He smiled an awkward smile, saluted, and then stood doubtfully on one foot and the other.
[Line 1011]  "Well?" I asked, surprised.  "What is the matter?"
[Line 1012]  "Nothing," he replied. 
[Line 1013] "Then you needn't stay," I said suggestively, and went on signing.  He
[Line 1014] didn't go.  He smiled again and swallowed.  I signed a dozen sheets or
[Line 1015] more and then looked up, and there he was, still smiling. 
[Line 1016] "Well," I asked, "what is the matter?  Out with it." 
[Line 1017] "We are all poor men," he said.
[Line 1018]  "Who are?" I asked carelessly.
[Line 1019]  "All we police," he said.  "I gave a whole rupee, but the others could give but a penny or twopence each because they are only constables.  We could not afford more.  We are poor men, your Honour." 
[Line 1020] I stopped my signing.  "Sergeant," I said, "come here.  I don't know what you're talking about.  What is the matter?"
[Line 1021] "There is a little girl," he answered, coming up to the table.  "That's
[Line 1022] the difficulty."
[Line 1023] I held my head between my hands.  I had no idea of what he could be
[Line 1024] talking about.  The syncopated method of beginning a conversation which Burmese often use made my head ache.  I stared, he stared.  At last I said:
[Line 1025]  "Sergeant, I'm going home," and rose.  Then it all came out.
[Line 1026]  It was the opium smuggler.  He could not pay the fine, for he was penniless.  He had no friends this side of fifty miles away, and he had
[Line 1027] with him a little daughter aged ten years or so.  This was, of course, the first that I had heard of her, but it seems that she was just
[Line 1028] outside when her father was being tried, and when she heard he had to
[Line 1029] go to gaol she was in despair.  They wept together.  Therefore the Sergeant whose zeal had caused the trouble repented of his work and took up a collection.  In the police-office and among my clerks he got five rupees.  That was but half, and they did not know
[Line 1030] where to get the rest.  Then someone had a brilliant idea.  "Go," he
[Line 1031] said to the Sergeant, "ask the magistrate."  "Therefore," said the Sergeant, "I came in to your Honour." 
[Line 1032] "For what?"  "The other five rupees."
[Line 1033] I laughed.  How could I help it?  The audacity of the demand, that I,
[Line 1034] the magistrate, should pay half the fine that I had myself inflicted!
[Line 1035] "Sergeant," I said severely, "what have you and I to do with offenders who break the law?  Are we to pay for them?  What is the good of _your_ arresting them and my fining them if we afterwards pay their fines for
[Line 1036] them?  We make a mockery of the law and ruin ourselves."
[Line 1037] He did not answer.  "You see the point?" I asked.
[Line 1038] He did.  "Then I am going home."  The Sergeant saluted.  "I didn't suppose your Honour has the money in Court.  Shall I come for it or will your Honour send it over?" he
[Line 1039] replied.  "Send what?" 
[Line 1040] "The five rupees."
[Line 1041]  I sent it over. 
[Line 1042] This story, besides illustrating the kindheartedness of the people and their quickness to see the injustice of a law and try to remedy it, shows the difficulty Government have in this matter of opium.  Now I do not intend to go into this very controversial subject.  I have read the evidence and the Report of the Opium Commission some years
[Line 1043] ago, and I have my own opinion about both.  That I will keep to myself.
[Line 1044] All I have to say here is that opium in reasonable doses is a most valuable drug--the most valuable we have.  It is in fever-haunted
[Line 1045] districts the best friend of the people.  Some of the best fighting men
[Line 1046] of the Empire take it and demand it.  In its time and place it is no
[Line 1047] more harmful than liquor, and I have no belief in putting the world
[Line 1048] into an iron case of everlasting "Don'ts."  People should be made
[Line 1049] temperate by training and judicious restriction of opportunity, and not
[Line 1050] made the slaves of laws.  I don't believe in slavery of any kind.
[Line 1051]  But opium can be and is abused, and there is no doubt that amongst the
[Line 1052] Burmese generally there is a desire that its use be totally prohibited.
[Line 1053] A general opinion like that should be respected whether it is right or
[Line 1054] wrong.
[Line 1055]  There comes the difficulty.  Take Burma as a whole and consider it. The vast majority of the inhabitants are Burmese, but in places in
[Line 1056] Lower Burma there are large colonies of Hindus and Mohammedans.  There
[Line 1057] are, moreover, many Chinese traders and carpenters spread about all
[Line 1058] over.  They are accustomed to use opium, were so accustomed before they came there, would not have come if they could not have got their
[Line 1059] stimulant.
[Line 1060] Then, again, Burma is bounded on the east by the independent Shan
[Line 1061] States, where there is a great deal of fever, where opium grows, and the people use it.  Beyond these States is China, where opium is grown
[Line 1062] largely.  Moreover, there are in Lower Burma one or two districts where
[Line 1063] fever is very deadly and opium is used by the Burmans with the consent of public opinion.
[Line 1064] Now sum up all these factors, and see how complicated the problem is.  The Burmans generally want opium prohibited.  "Very well," says
[Line 1065] Government; "we will prohibit it for Burmans; but what about the rest
[Line 1066] of the population?  They want it; their public opinion does not forbid
[Line 1067] it.  They are immigrants, and would not have come if they had been unable to get it.  Therefore there must be opium shops for them.  But
[Line 1068] Burmans shall not be allowed to buy."
[Line 1069]  So far so good in appearance.  The Burman may not buy from the shop,
[Line 1070] and doesn't.  He buys from a friendly Chinaman, who for a little
[Line 1071] commission buys the opium at the shop and hands it over outside.
[Line 1072]  But this trick was discovered, and Government did its best.  It allowanced all Chinamen.  They could buy so much and no more, just enough for their own use.  If they sold to Burmans they had to go without themselves.  That was excellent, only there were two ways round.  One was for
[Line 1073] Chinamen who did not use opium--not all do--to act as honest broker;
[Line 1074] the other was smuggling from the Shan States.  The quantity of opium smuggled down from the Shan States cannot be estimated, nor can it be stopped.  How can you guard five hundred miles of frontier all mountain and forest, intersected by forest paths?  Opium is light, compact,
[Line 1075] easily concealed.  Government does its best, but it cannot do the impossible.  Therefore the Acts are widely evaded, which is always a bad thing; but
[Line 1076] there is a worse effect than this--there is discrimination by
[Line 1077] nationality. 
[Line 1078] I do not think there can be anything worse than an Act that says such and such an act is right and proper for people of one nationality but
[Line 1079] wrong and penal for people of another.  A Chinaman may walk about and do openly what if a Burman does he goes to gaol for.  What difference is there between the natures of the two people to make such a
[Line 1080] difference?  There is none.  Therefore the effect of this law, although it be according to the general desire, is to make the Burman feel that
[Line 1081] he is a child not to be trusted.  This is a bad feeling.  If opium were
[Line 1082] totally prohibited in Upper Burma for everybody except Indian troops or officials sent there by Government, and therefore not free to stay
[Line 1083] away, this feeling would not arise.  If local option is to have effect it should be by areas and not races.
[Line 1084]  The same thing applies to alcohol.  An Indian coolie can go and buy
[Line 1085] some liquor and have a drink with his friends.  A Burman may not.  At least not of licit liquor.  Therefore a great deal of illicit liquor is distilled.
[Line 1086] Try to see how demoralising all this is.  Take a town like Sagaing, my last head-quarters, which is really only a big village, and note the results.  There is a liquor shop where European liquors, beer, and
[Line 1087] spirits are sold, and there are several shops where native spirits are sold.  A European, or half-caste, or Hindu, or Mohammedan of the better classes could go and buy a bottle of Bass or of Dyer's ale at the European shop and take it home for dinner.  The Burmese magistrates, inspectors of police, and so on could not--legally.  My Treasury
[Line 1088] officer, being a Burman, was debarred; his subordinate, a native of India, was not debarred.  What happens?  Well, I don't know.  But I bought a pony once from a very respectable and able Burmese Inspector
[Line 1089] of Police, and the first morning I rode him he took me gently but firmly to the back door of the liquor shop.  That gave me an idea, but
[Line 1090] I kept the idea to myself.  I have often had ideas of this nature.
[Line 1091]  Then take the poorer classes.  Is it good for one race of people to see
[Line 1092] another making merry with a glass while it is illegal for them to do so?  Does it not create bitterness, to say the least?  Does it not perpetuate differences that must disappear if self-government is to
[Line 1093] succeed?
[Line 1094] Here, again, if laws are to succeed they must be in accordance with the desires of the people.  Only the people at large can stop smuggling. Read the history of how English smuggling was stopped; it was because
[Line 1095] no one could smuggle without being informed on--that is to say, public opinion had turned against them.
[Line 1096] But that is not so in Burma.  Were prohibition of opium or spirits by localities where all were treated alike, you could ask the people to help you to enforce their wish.  But for opium and liquor to be sold to
[Line 1097] some and refused to others is not a local option.  No one likes it, and no one will help to stop smuggling.  That is human nature.  
[Line 1098] Government has been and is greatly abused for its opium and liquor
[Line 1099] policy, but I think if facts are looked at squarely it will be seen
[Line 1100] that the situation is very difficult.  The only way out that I can see is through local self-government.  If the scheme that I sketch out at
[Line 1101] the end of this book took form there would be local option eventually, and people will submit to what they themselves enact, whereas they
[Line 1102] chafe against the same thing when imposed from above.  That is human
[Line 1103] nature, and it is a very valuable trait of human nature.  It is the revolt against subjection, and the declaration that the objective of
[Line 1104] life is to be free.  The only morality of any value comes from within; that imposed from without may improve the body, but it enervates the soul.  Now the body is temporary and the soul eternal.   Here I may end my criticism of the machinery of government.  Not that any of the other branches of the administration are better than those I
[Line 1105] have written of.  The land laws are, I think, worse, because they are based on imported fixed ideas and not on any careful investigation of facts and the underlying causes of facts.  The police administration is bad; the village administration worse than bad.  But I do not want to criticise; I want to establish my point, which is that the unrest in
[Line 1106] India is a legitimate unrest, that it is not factitious or political,
[Line 1107] but based on very real grievances that must grow till they are relieved. 
[Line 1108] I have picked out these four branches of the administration: the
[Line 1109] Criminal and Civil Courts, the Villages, and the Opium and Excise, for specific reasons.  The reason I chose the first two is because no one ever seems to have suspected before how bad they were.  Everyone has
[Line 1110] gone on the fixed idea that because the magistrates and judges are
[Line 1111] honest and the law up to date there can be nothing to complain of in them.  The fault must be in the people.
[Line 1112] Only as I write I get a letter to this effect from an officer of long
[Line 1113] experience.  He had "never seen anything wrong with the Courts."
[Line 1114] Therefore I have set out the facts to the best of my ability.  I want
[Line 1115] the reader to see for himself.  I don't want him to accept my authority
[Line 1116] that they are bad; I don't believe in authority.  I want him to think
[Line 1117] over the facts I have laid before him and frame his own judgment.  I think that he will see that the Courts which have been declared
[Line 1118] impregnable are very vulnerable indeed. 
[Line 1119] The reason I chose the Village is because it is the unit of
[Line 1120] self-government.
[Line 1121]  The reason I chose the Opium and Excise was different.  Whereas
[Line 1122] Government has never been criticised for its Courts and its law, which
[Line 1123] are bad, it has received unending criticism for its Opium and Excise policy.  Yet, mistakes apart, I don't see how it is much to blame.  The
[Line 1124] difficulties are inherent.  They are the same in nature as those that beset liquor legislation in England.  The question has not been solved here; far from it.  In fact, it is insoluble by Act; it is only soluble by education of the individual.  The right and temperate use of alcohol
[Line 1125] and drugs is a personal, not a State question.  Therefore where
[Line 1126] Government could have been criticised it was not, and where it did its
[Line 1127] best in great difficulties it was abused.  This will give a key to
[Line 1128] another difficulty in India: Government receives hardly any good and useful criticism from any side.  It is abused and praised, but that
[Line 1129] understanding criticism which is of the greatest value to individuals and Governments is wanting.  The Indians are feeling serious unrest,
[Line 1130] and they cannot diagnose the cause--no one can diagnose himself--so they strike out at random against Government measures and officials. They are like a certain party in England who also are unhappy with
[Line 1131] things as they are, and who express their dissatisfaction at, say, the
[Line 1132] marriage laws--which were made not by man, but by Churches, whose great
[Line 1133] supporters were and are women--by smashing the orchid house at Kew.  It
[Line 1134] reminds me of Andrew Lang's ghost.  What he wanted to say was that the drains were out of order and a danger to all the inhabitants of the
[Line 1135] castle.  But he suffered from aphasia, and the nearest he could get to
[Line 1136] an indication of his meaning was driving round and round the castle at
[Line 1137] midnight in a hearse and four.  Most changes arising in societies are incoherent in the same way, but it must not be supposed that because the expression is irrelevant there is no real and serious cause beneath it.  When an overboiling kettle spills and scalds the cat who never did the kettle any harm, it is hard
[Line 1138] luck on the cat, but it is not unnatural in the kettle.  And it would
[Line 1139] be dangerous therefore to stop up the spout.  Later on the kettle might explode and damage the cat's master. 
[Line 1140] The English papers in India want to support Government, which is right;
[Line 1141] but the best support they could give would be to point out where Government goes wrong and help it to go right.  They never do that,
[Line 1142] because the editors live in towns and know nothing of the country.
[Line 1143] Moreover, they too suffer from fixed ideas.
[Line 1144]  It is the same with the criticism the Indian Government gets from
[Line 1145] England.  There are here practically only two parties.  One says, "Sit tight on the safety-valve and shoot anyone who comes near you"; and the other says "Give government to the people."  Now there is no organised
[Line 1146] Indian people as yet to give it to.  No Government has ever had so little help from intelligent criticism as
[Line 1147] the Indian Government; none ever needed it more.  No Government in the
[Line 1148] world is more sincerely desirous of the good of the people it governs; none knows so little how to secure it.
[Line 1149] You cannot have any work done efficiently unless there is honest and understanding criticism.  No sensible person objects to it if it is
[Line 1150] given sincerely and fairly.  But that is not so in India.  Considering how unfair most criticism of the Indian Government is, it shows great
[Line 1151] self-restraint in the consideration it accords to it.  And you can't expect Government officials to criticise themselves.  It isn't part of
[Line 1152] their functions and it isn't fair to ask it.  Their duty is to carry out the laws and orders they receive.  They have neither the time nor the attitude of mind to be always criticising them. 
[Line 1153] But there ought to be somebody whose function is to investigate the working of government, and to suggest and criticise.  In England it
[Line 1154] used to be done--badly--by Parliament and the papers.  Now no one does it: everyone now only seeks "party" advantage.  In China there used to be censors whose duty it was, I am told, to watch the working of the machine and criticise it.  That would be an admirable idea if it could be carried out.
[Line 1155]  The Government of India should have censors.  They should be well paid, and I think their lives would have to be heavily insured.  Their reports should not be pigeon-holed, but published.
[Line 1156]  At present this ill-informed criticism of Government has succeeded in
[Line 1157] achieving one and is pressing another measure for the alleviation of the unrest which can do nothing but harm.  The danger is that Government, not knowing the right thing to do and pressed to do
[Line 1158] something, will accept these measures rather than be accused of ignoring the unrest.  India is lost to us--lost in spirit, and only awaiting the opportunity
[Line 1159] to be lost in substance.  How shall she be regained?
[Line 1160] Government have two ideas.  Let us see what these are.

[Line 1163]  COUNSELS OF DESPAIR
[Line 1164]    CHAPTER X 
[Line 1165] THE COUNCILS 
[Line 1166] The first step that has been taken with the hope of allaying the
[Line 1167] discontent in India has been the increase in the Councils of the
[Line 1168] Government of India and of the Local Governments of Madras and Bombay, with the creation of Councils in the other Provinces which did not have
[Line 1169] them before. 
[Line 1170] And as these Councils have been in certain quarters greatly praised as
[Line 1171] being not only good in themselves now but as containing the germs of
[Line 1172] great possibilities, it is necessary to consider them carefully.
[Line 1173] Councils were first instituted in India in 1861, were enlarged in 1892,
[Line 1174] and again much enlarged in 1909; thus they are no new thing, and their value is already fairly obvious.  Moreover, since the enlargements of the Act of 1909 some time has elapsed, so that I am not here criticising institutions which have not yet had a chance of showing what they can do.
[Line 1175] There are Executive Councils for the Government of India and for the Provincial Governments of Bombay and Madras, and there are Legislative
[Line 1176] Councils for the Government of India and for each Province.
[Line 1177]  The whole of the law for the constitution of these Councils is contained in the Indian Councils Acts of 1861, 1892, and 1909, and the
[Line 1178] Rules for the nomination or election of the members are contained in
[Line 1179] Blue Book Number Cd 6714, published in 1913.  I give these references in order that anyone who cares to go into the subject in greater detail
[Line 1180] than I can in this chapter will be able to find all his material
[Line 1181] readily.  He will be able to see how other Councils than those I intend to deal with here are constituted; also in what way and by what
[Line 1182] constituencies elected members are chosen.  There is a great deal that
[Line 1183] might well be said on each of these Councils.  But the only Councils I propose to deal with here are those of the
[Line 1184] Government of India and of the Province of Burma.  I would have liked
[Line 1185] to include the Council of Madras but that I think the subject can be
[Line 1186] fairly understood without this.
[Line 1187]  The Executive Council of the Government of India consists of the
[Line 1188] Governor-General and nine members.  These form the Cabinet of India,
[Line 1189] and, subject to the control of the Secretary of State, it has supreme
[Line 1190] power.  It includes the Commander-in-Chief and members for Finance, Public Works, Home affairs and so on. 
[Line 1191] The only alteration made in this Council is by declaring that one of
[Line 1192] the members must be an Indian.  So far that member has been the Law
[Line 1193] Member, and it is somewhat difficult to see how any other post could be
[Line 1194] filled by an Indian.  You can find Indian lawyers, many, perhaps too many of them, but where are you to find Indians with that necessary experience that would fit them to be Finance or Home Members or
[Line 1195] Commander-in-Chief, for instance?
[Line 1196] The appointment of this Indian gentleman to be Law Member has not been
[Line 1197] followed by any striking results.  Law in India is petrified, and until
[Line 1198] the great reform takes place petrified it must remain.  It does not
[Line 1199] seem to matter very much who is head of it.  When reform comes it will
[Line 1200] not be an Indian who could undertake it.
[Line 1201]  The Legislative Council is formed of the Executive Council and
[Line 1202] Additional Members.  Before 1909, Additional Members were few, they were nominated and there was always a good Government majority.  Since
[Line 1203] 1909 it has been constituted as follows:    Nominated Members   28 officials   5 non-officials.
[Line 1204]  Of these five non-officials one is to represent the Indian Commercial
[Line 1205] community, one the Mohammedans of the Punjab, and one the landowners in the Punjab.  The other two nominated members may be anyone apparently. 
[Line 1206] Then there are twenty-seven elected members; two each to represent the four large Provincial Councils; one each for the five smaller
[Line 1207] Provinces, one each to represent the landowners of six Provinces; five representatives of Mohammedans in these five Provinces; one member each
[Line 1208] to the Chambers of Commerce of Bengal and Bombay; and one extra Mohammedan member.  Thus in this assembly there are represented in a
[Line 1209] way nine Provinces as wholes, the landowning class of some Provinces, one religion and the trade of two cities.
[Line 1210]  To make it clearer to the reader who has not been to India, let me put it in this way.  India is as big as Europe without Russia, and has
[Line 1211] three hundred million inhabitants, more than Europe.  Suppose Europe were conquered and administered by Martians, and they were to establish a Council.  If they did it on similar principles to this Legislative Council of the Government of India it would consist of:
[Line 1212]  Two members each for Germany, France, Great Britain, and Italy, one member each for five smaller nations, one representative each for the landowners in Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Austria, and
[Line 1213] Spain, five representatives of Protestants as Protestants, and one each
[Line 1214] for the Chambers of Commerce of London and Paris.
[Line 1215] What would the reader think of this as a Council to make laws for all
[Line 1216] Europe?  What would he say?  I think he would say many things.  He would also ask some questions.  He would ask:
[Line 1217]  Firstly, how can two members represent great countries--like England
[Line 1218] for instance?  Or one represent another great area and people like
[Line 1219] Spain?  Is it conceivably possible that one or at best two individuals could have the necessary knowledge or impartiality to do this?  His second question would be: How can one man represent landowners spread over a great territory with different forms of tenure, different
[Line 1220] crops, different climates, different nationalities? 
[Line 1221] His third would be: Two cities are represented; where are the others?  His fourth would be: At best, all these members can but represent, in even ever so faint a way, their own class who elects them.  Say at a
[Line 1222] liberal estimate that they represent more or less imperfectly half a million people; what about the two hundred and ninety-nine and a half
[Line 1223] million who are left out?  Who are to protect tenants from landlords,
[Line 1224] the innumerable unrepresented religions from that one which is
[Line 1225] represented, the voiceless cities from the two which have voices?  In fact, who is to protect Europe from these few privileged classes? 
[Line 1226] That would be analogous to what is happening in India.  These questions are being asked. 
[Line 1227] The answer to the first question is quite simple.  The two members do
[Line 1228] not represent Madras, nor does the one member represent Burma.  They represent the non-officials of the Local Council, and that is all; that
[Line 1229] is to say, ten or fifteen individuals of much their own class and
[Line 1230] standing.  It is not likely that they have any knowledge of the country
[Line 1231] they are to represent, except the chief town.  It is quite certain that they have never even travelled over half their country, nor speak more than one or two of the various tongues.  They have no knowledge of the administration anywhere, nor any
[Line 1232] administrative ability.  If a question vital to their Province arose they would not know what to do; and if they did know they would not dare to do it if it involved any responsibility, because they have no backing in the country supposed to be theirs.  They are totally
[Line 1233] unknown, even by name, to nine hundred and ninety-nine out of every thousand inhabitants.  In fact, even this is an over-estimate.  They are not only without knowledge of the immense majority of "their" people, but are antagonistic in race and religion to many of them, so that it is only the English Government that keeps the peace.  The answer to the second question is much the same as to the first. Fancy one member representing the Nair landholders of Malabar, the Poligars, the Tamils, the Telugu landholders, and many others.  It is
[Line 1234] absurd. 
[Line 1235] There is no answer to the third question.
[Line 1236] The answer to the fourth is that whatever help and representation and defence the bulk of India can obtain must be obtained from the English
[Line 1237] official members.  They alone are quite impartial; they may be
[Line 1238] comparatively ignorant, but their ignorance is light compared to that of the native members, for it includes a knowledge of administration obtained by experience, which none of the latter have.  It is we alone
[Line 1239] who have raised the people economically, and have done it often enough
[Line 1240] against the influence of class.
[Line 1241] Therefore the Council of the Government of India is so constituted that whereas perhaps half a million people are represented directly or indirectly by class and religion, the two hundred and ninety-nine and a half million have no representation at all and must depend on the
[Line 1242] English officials. 
[Line 1243] This is no new discovery of mine.  Here is what Lord Curzon said in the debate in the House of Lords on this new Act: "I wonder how these
[Line 1244] changes will in the last resort affect the great mass of the people of India--the people who have no vote and have scarcely a voice.  Remember
[Line 1245] that to these people, who form the bulk of the population of India, representative government and electoral institutions are nothing
[Line 1246] whatever.  I have a misgiving that this class will not fare much better under these changes than they do now.  At any rate, I see no place for
[Line 1247] them in these enlarged Councils which are to be created, and I am under
[Line 1248] the strong opinion that as government in India becomes more and more
[Line 1249] Parliamentary--as will be the inevitable result--so it will become less paternal and less beneficial to the poorer classes of the population." It was seen that these Councils were merely by way of handing over the
[Line 1250] India we have made to a tiny section of privileged classes whom we were
[Line 1251] to keep in power and support with our bayonets.  It was seen and
[Line 1252] disregarded.  Why?
[Line 1253] So much for its constitution.  Every principle that experience shows
[Line 1254] must go to the making of a successful Assembly has been scorned.  The representation, even such as it is, is by class, by race, and by
[Line 1255] religion.  No assembly where such a method of representation has been
[Line 1256] adopted has ever been known.  Wherever, even in a small degree, such differences have existed it has paralysed all action.  Take, for
[Line 1257] instance, the French National Assembly before the Revolution.  Imagine a House of Commons with members for landowners, for the merchants of
[Line 1258] London and Glasgow, and special members for the Catholic Irish in England and Scotland.  Even that would be far less extraordinary than the Council of India.  This Council has no executive powers, but it can ask questions: it can discuss the Budget though it cannot make alterations; it can make laws
[Line 1259] affecting all India.  But all it does is subject to veto by the Government of India--and naturally so.  How could you delegate real power to a Council which, the English officials apart, has no representative value of any kind and no administrative experience?  The power behind the Government is the power of England--the Army, the
[Line 1260] Navy, and the wealth of England.  It is administered by British officials, and even the native army is officered by English officers. Is this great English organism to be used for enforcing laws passed by such a Council as that I have described?  To be at its mercy, to be its
[Line 1261] servant?  Does it enter into the possibility of things? 
[Line 1262] The Council, the officials apart, is in reality at its very best advisory only.  It cannot be more.  It has no power behind it and could be given no responsibility.  Yet without the fear of responsibility what advice is ever well given?  Irresponsible advisers!  Of what value
[Line 1263] have they ever been in the world's history?
[Line 1264]  "But"--I have been told and have read often enough--"the Council works well, it is a success, it has gratified the educated Indian.  Why
[Line 1265] criticise it, then?"  To that I reply, "In what has its success
[Line 1266] consisted--what has it done?"  And to that I never get any answer except that it is a success because it has done nothing.  The speakers
[Line 1267] were afraid, apparently, it might try to do something--to express, for
[Line 1268] instance, some of the desires and needs of the people, a few of which I have tried to explain in this book; to suggest some new policy to Government, to show how the great and increasing unrest might be guided into safe channels; and it has been a success because it has done none
[Line 1269] of these things and was capable of doing none of them.  It has been as an influence _nil_.  All it has done has been empty criticism.  A writer trying to praise it says: "The debates in the Imperial Council
[Line 1270] are already not unworthy of older and more famous assemblies."  If the comparison is with the House of Commons it is not inapt.  For many
[Line 1271] years now debates there have been merely a pretence.  The conclusions are already fixed and the speakers know it.  They speak to pass time, to satisfy the electors that they are really doing something to justify their existence, and they try to show off--or to score off someone else.  Their speeches have no value.  They make no difference to the
[Line 1272] result.  And the debates in the India Council are no different.  It
[Line 1273] perhaps gives the members the illusion of power and authority to be able to badger Government and make long speeches, but it can effect nothing.  The debates are make-believe.  How should they be anything else?  The men are not to blame, but the institution.
[Line 1274]  "But"--again say its advocates--"this is but a beginning.  The Council is but in embryo.  Wait till it comes to greater maturity."
[Line 1275]  To what greater maturity can it come?  Is there in this Council any
[Line 1276] true idea that can expand and grow?  There is no idea at all.  Is it ever contemplated to make it really representative?  How many members
[Line 1277] would it take to represent three hundred millions of people?  On the British basis, not a liberal one, it would require an assembly of over four thousand five hundred members.  Is that possible?
[Line 1278]  Is any election possible among the masses of the people? 
[Line 1279] Is it ever possible that real executive or legislative power should be given to an assembly when it is the English Government and the English
[Line 1280] people who in the last resort would have to carry out those orders and
[Line 1281] bear the brunt of their failure?
[Line 1282]  Think over the facts carefully.  Could you make a central Parliament to govern all Europe?  No.  For a hundred reasons the idea is impossible. It is equally impossible in India.  It is even more impossible in India than it would be in Europe.  Finally it is said that this Council has satisfied the educated class in India.  Has it? 
[Line 1283] And if it had could there be a greater criterion of its worthlessness than such satisfaction?
[Line 1284] Let us now turn to the Burma Provincial Council.  There is no Executive
[Line 1285] Council, all executive power lies with the Lieut.-Governor.  The Legislative Council consists of seventeen members.
[Line 1286] One member is elected by the Chamber of Commerce, and the other sixteen
[Line 1287] are nominated.  Of these sixteen, six may be officials; two experts may
[Line 1288] be official or non-official; the rest must be non-official; of these, four must be Burmese, one must be Chinese, and one must be Indian.
[Line 1289] The Council has power to enact local legislation for Burma only.  That is to say it can pass special or local laws.  It cannot, of course, interfere with or vary the Imperial legislation, such as the Indian Penal Codes.  Its powers are small and are limited.  It is, as will be
[Line 1290] seen, representative of nothing.  Except the officials, none of the
[Line 1291] members have any administrative knowledge; none are known to the people
[Line 1292] at large even by name.  That they approved or passed any Act modifying, say, the Burmese law of inheritance, would be no justification for it before the people.  They represent neither people nor ideas.  They have
[Line 1293] effected nothing and can effect nothing because they have no force
[Line 1294] behind them.  What have any of them ever done that the people should repose confidence in them?
[Line 1295]  For the rest the same criticisms apply as to the Indian Council.  The
[Line 1296] Lieut.-Governor has all the executive power and he has the power of
[Line 1297] veto over all legislation.  Naturally he must have this power.  If not, he might be forced into using British power and authority and means for
[Line 1298] enforcing Acts that he disapproved of and were passed by men who
[Line 1299] represented at best not one thousandth part of the country.  Yet, as long as he has this power of veto, the Council, like the Indian Council, becomes simply an advisory Council with no responsibility. And, again, of what value is advice that is not steadied by the sense
[Line 1300] of responsibility? 
[Line 1301] And with all this talk of self-government, of an Imperial Indian
[Line 1302] Parliament and local parliaments, of election and representation, there
[Line 1303] is in no village in the Indian Empire any self-government at all, even in the smallest matters.  The villages are one and all under the rule of a Government official, and every vestige of self-government has been
[Line 1304] destroyed.  India may have representatives in the India Council and a voice, even if an impotent voice, in Imperial matters, but it may have
[Line 1305] no representation in its Village Council, and no voice in the smallest village concern.  The whole base on which any self-government could rest has been
[Line 1306] destroyed.  And instead of building up from below a system of
[Line 1307] self-government that would proceed from the people and be so founded as to stand any shocks, it is sought to begin self-government from the
[Line 1308] top, by suspending in the air Councils that rest on nothing, that mean
[Line 1309] nothing, that have as much solidity and reality as kites would have.  This, too, must have been foreseen, because it is obvious.  Why, then,
[Line 1310] was it done? 
[Line 1311] Was there ever in any history a _reductio ad absurdum_ like these Councils of Despair?
[Line 1312]    
[Line 1313] CHAPTER XI
[Line 1314]  THE INDIAN AS CIVILIAN
[Line 1315] The next measure which has insistently been pressed on the Government is that far more Indians should be admitted to the Civil Service.  It is now composed almost exclusively of Englishmen, and the conditions
[Line 1316] are such that it is difficult for Indians to enter.  This, it is claimed, should be altered, and the Civil Service should be to a great
[Line 1317] extent Indianised.
[Line 1318]  Well, as I have said, the Government of India is not Indian, it is
[Line 1319] English.  It is essentially English, the more so and the more
[Line 1320] necessarily so because it is in India.  It consists of very few members compared to the work it has to do, and it is of the highest importance therefore that it be completely efficient.  England has made herself responsible for India, and she cannot shirk or divide this responsibility.  She cannot say: "I will by admitting a few Indians
[Line 1321] into the service shift some of the responsibility onto them and so onto
[Line 1322] India."  That is unthinkable.  The Government of India is English, and until by revolution or devolution it disappears it must remain English.
[Line 1323] It is the Army and Navy of England which ensure India's safety. Therefore her first duty, not only to herself but to India, is to enlist in her superior service such men as will govern most efficiently.
[Line 1324]  Now to govern efficiently we must govern in our own way.  There are not for us nor any people two ways of doing a thing well; there is one way
[Line 1325] only possible at the time--one way in which the genius of the governing
[Line 1326] race can best express itself.  That is the one we must follow, and to ensure its success we must have in the service men who are not merely by education, but by what is far more important, by instinct, best
[Line 1327] fitted to carry out the ideas of government.  You must have officers
[Line 1328] who will know what to do not only when they are told, but when they are
[Line 1329] not told, who, being one in race and feeling with the Government, will instinctively do all in accordance with it.
[Line 1330]  For it must never be forgotten that the government of India is a very
[Line 1331] difficult matter, and will always be so.  It is not plain-sailing, like the Local Government of any self-governing people, or even of Russia.
[Line 1332] The administration of India is alien.  The system is alien; and though it need not be so much out of touch with the people as it is now, alien
[Line 1333] it must remain.  As long as the government is alien the machinery must
[Line 1334] be so.  Englishmen could not work machinery they did not understand.  Even in self-governed countries there is always a feeling against
[Line 1335] government.  Taxes are hard things to bear.  This is shown in socialism
[Line 1336] and many other ways.  But in an alien-governed country like India this
[Line 1337] discontent is much greater.  Government has not only to bear the blame
[Line 1338] for its own faults, but has to vicariously suffer for the shortcomings of the monsoons and the inroad of plague.  It is responsible, in the people's ideas, for everything.  The internal peace which is taken for granted in most European countries cannot be so assumed in India.  We are very often within measurable distance of riot, and an unchecked riot may quickly develop into an insurrection.  The first essential, therefore, of government is the maintenance of peace and the immediate suppression of any symptom of unrest.  Now the forces at the disposal of the authorities are not large.  For
[Line 1339] the whole province of Burma, as large as France and England, and with a
[Line 1340] thousand miles of wild frontier and ten millions of people, there are
[Line 1341] only four British and eight Indian regiments.  There are, or were, besides (I have not the latest figures) some ten thousand military police, who are men recruited in India and officered by English officers from Indian regiments.  The Burmese police are only for civil
[Line 1342] duty and detection.  They are not for "keeping the peace" purposes. For the whole of India there are but 70,000 British troops and 140,000
[Line 1343] native for a population of 350,000,000, with a difficult and turbulent frontier.  There is manifestly no margin to waste; the resources
[Line 1344] available must be used with the utmost efficiency.  There must be direct understanding and co-operation between the military officers who
[Line 1345] command the forces and the District Officers who supply the
[Line 1346] information, the intelligence and the direction.  Now if the District Officer were an Indian this could not be.  It is no reflection on either the courage or the capacity of the Indian to say this, for the
[Line 1347] quality necessary is neither of these.  It is one which he does not and cannot have, but which is essential for the proper carrying out of his duties.  It is _camaraderie_ with the other officers.
[Line 1348]  Official relations between civil and military are always difficult.  It
[Line 1349] is impossible to lay down hard and fast rules defining their respective responsibilities.  There is a certain antagonism between the objects
[Line 1350] each wishes to attain and the way to attain them.  The civilian wishes
[Line 1351] as far as possible to avoid bloodshed; to soothe, not irritate, nor
[Line 1352] threaten.  Fighting is the last thing he wants.  The soldier, on the
[Line 1353] other hand, wants to get at his enemy and have it over; to stir him up
[Line 1354] if he be not already stirred up enough.  He wishes action that is
[Line 1355] short, sharp, and decisive.  The civilian is long-suffering.  Therefore
[Line 1356] disagreements arise, and that these conflicts of official opinion
[Line 1357] should be minimised, something more is necessary than that the men on both sides be good officers.  They must be friends.  The rubs of
[Line 1358] official intercourse must be effaced over the mess-table, the card-table, the camp fire; must be forgotten in talks of home, of
[Line 1359] mutual friends.  How often has it not happened that it has been the mutual appreciation of a poet, the remembrance of a charming woman, the admiration of an opera, that has rendered possible that co-operation
[Line 1360] which is the soul of work.  There must be the continual consciousness on both sides that theirs is not a temporary official relationship.
[Line 1361] They will meet continually hereafter at other stations, at head-quarters, at dinners, races, clubs--in the East and at home.  They
[Line 1362] must be friends all through; there must be a mutual understanding.  Now if the civilian were an Indian gentleman all this could not occur. That Indians are often honourable and cultured gentlemen I know; that
[Line 1363] in essence all humanity is one I am never tired of affirming.  But
[Line 1364] there are differences of race, real differences, important differences,
[Line 1365] differences that the Indian himself should be the last to try to
[Line 1366] ignore.  Every nation is given by nature the qualities peculiar to it and which it is its duty to cultivate for the world's sake.  To attempt
[Line 1367] to sink your individuality in that of another is an injury not only to yourself but to the whole world.  An Indian gentleman cannot be an Englishman.  It is no use his trying.  He only makes himself absurd. He can be something quite as good if he will cultivate his own talent;
[Line 1368] but he has not our talent.  He is not an Englishman, and only an Englishman by birth has that _camaraderie_ with other Englishmen that
[Line 1369] is essential.  Even a Frenchman or a German would not have it.
[Line 1370] Therefore it would be impossible to place Indian civilians in places
[Line 1371] where co-operation with military or military police-officers would be
[Line 1372] essential.
[Line 1373]  Further, it is not the English officers alone who create the difficulty.  It is the men--English and native.  Men of fighting races
[Line 1374] in India will not acknowledge the authority of Indians of other nationalities, even if supported by Government.  I will tell a story in illustration. 
[Line 1375] I was stationed nearly twenty years ago at a district head-quarters in
[Line 1376] Burma where there was a battalion of Military Police recruited in Upper
[Line 1377] India.  There was also a young Mohammedan civilian who had passed into
[Line 1378] the Civil Service in London and been posted to Burma.  He was an excellent fellow in his way. 
[Line 1379] It happened one morning that I rode down to the Battalion Commandant's house to see him on some matter.  We discussed our business, and after it was finished the Subadar of the battalion, a great soldierly Sikh,
[Line 1380] came in.  He and the Commandant talked for a while, and when he was leaving E. said:
[Line 1381]  "By the by, Subadar Sahib, we are coming up this evening to the range to do a little firing.  Send up the marker and four rifles."
[Line 1382]  "_Four_ rifles?" queried the Subadar. 
[Line 1383] E. nodded.
[Line 1384] "For whom?" 
[Line 1385] "For the four Sahibs," said E.
[Line 1386] The Subadar counted.  "The Deputy Sahib, Huzoor (E.), Hall Sahib, and who else?'
[Line 1387] "Oh," said he, "Mahommed V. Sahib," naming the Indian civilian.
[Line 1388]  The Subadar turned away with a gesture of scorn.
[Line 1389]  "A sahib? he?" he growled. 
[Line 1390] Now suppose this Indian civilian had grown up into charge of a district and had to direct or go with these men into action?  What would happen?
[Line 1391]  But it may be said that matters could be so arranged that civilians who
[Line 1392] were Indians were not posted to troublesome or frontier districts, or that they were given judicial and not executive appointments.  They
